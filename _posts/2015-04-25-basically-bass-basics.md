So, I play [Electric Bass][bass].

My Bass is an [Ibanez Soundgear Gio][ibanez], and I play almost
exclusively in [Standard Tuning][bassstandard] now. I am pretty well
versed in both Rock and Pop style basics, and if I want or need to
play a song I can pick it up by ear fairly quickly. I know my scales
(the ones I've used, anyway), and I can safely and securely call
myself a **Bassist** because of all of these things.

But I want more.

So, I looked to the areas I am lacking experience with:
Jazz/Fusion/Traditional and Classical/Baroque/Early Music. Today, I'll
discuss what I have been working on lately, which is Classical Music.

I've been working through the beginning of a
[Double Bass][doublebass] method from the 1910s which is freely
available in the [public domain][publicdomain] on [IMSLP][imslp]. I am
nearly completely ignoring the bowing section, but the rest of the
book is useful, and the [Double Bass][doublebass] has a similar tuning
to the [Electric Bass][bass]. Interestingly, it focuses a lot on the
left hand's position as opposed to simply focusing on scales from the
start... though, I suppose the [Chromatic Scale][chromatic] counts as
a scale.

It's really working out my reading chops, too... which is something I
haven't had much cause to use before now. I can only consider that a
good thing, but it is definitely the limiting factor right now as to
how much I get through in the time I allot to the method. As a
musician who learned originally to play by ear, sight reading is
something I have never been very good at.

But, I digress.

I'm hoping that working through this method will give me new insight
and ability on the instrument, and even help me understand how to
better compose for it. I'll let You know how it goes.
