**tl;dr:** _Dragon Breed is a shooter from IREM, which runs fine under
  current versions of MAME. It is hard and different, and I like it._

'I recently was looking for some nice, challenging shooter titles,
since my game library is severly lacking in those[aside from Darius]
and that was unacceptable to me. Dragon Breed is different from normal
shooters in a different way than Darius, and is very satisfying to
make progress in. This title screen doesn't really do it justice, but
it does get the name out there, and I guess IREM thought it
represented their product fairly well... so, here ya go.')](http://i.imgur.com/FRWgMt3.png)

In terms of CAR (the three main needs which are satisfied by gaming:
Competence, Autonomy, and
Relatedness. [Good Video on the subject here][CAR]) some of the best
representations of high _Competence_ gaming are the shooter games
(also called shoot'em ups or shmups).

I have always had a fondness for shooters; one of my first memories in
video games was a game called _Stargunner_, published by
Apogee. However, my current library was lacking a strong
representation of these games... so I went looking for new ones
recently.

I found _Dragon Breed_.

'This image is rather tame, but shows the difference between the
dragon [which is invincible] and Your character [which is extremely
vulnerable] very well. While it is true that having this huge
invincible wall around You makes certain situations easier, the
designers really took advantage of that benefit and made the enemies
that much more accurate towards Your very vulnerable character. It is
surprisingly hard to protect this little guy, and doing so feels both
rewarding and intense.')](http://i.imgur.com/LOcemLu.png)

Dragon Breed, by IREM, is a horizontal shooter which has a major
difference from most other shooters in that _You are riding a large,
invincible dragon_ instead of being in some kind of ship. This makes
Your own hitbox relatively small and well-protected versus most other
games, and at first glance, You may think that this makes it too easy.

But that is the opposite of the truth.

The game is designed to mitigate this invincibility by making the
enemies aware of this. The enemies will never directly attack the
dragon, instead shooting directly for You. This makes the game
interesting, as You can block shots with the dragon, but rarely will a
shot be _accidently_ blocked because of the way it was shot.

And yeah, You die a lot in this game.

'It was difficult for me to get a good shot of this, so instead I went
for a cool simple image and I'll tell You here instead[Don't tell anyone
I cheated, kay?]. The opening cutscene of this game is Your character
walking along a cliff, taking a furturistic looking gun, and SHOOTING
AT A DRAGON EGG until it hatches. As soon as this dragon is born, You
jump on top of it, and now have full control over this invincible,
super strong, laser shooting, flying new-born dragon which You use to
mow down thousands of evil laser-shooting bugs and bosses. That scene
alone made this game to me. So cool. ')](http://i.imgur.com/zqoTVwh.png)

I am very interested in beating this game, and I might post a more
thorough look at it when I have done so, but my first impressions with
this game are very positive.

The difficulty is high without being impossible, and for a
non-bullet-hell shooter that is a delicate balance to achieve. The
dragon mechanic, by far the most notable aspect of the game, provides
a different experience than most shooters in that You _want_ part of
Your "ship" to get hit instead of trying to always avoid every
shot. And the art and music are both very well done.

Good thing I don't actually need to feed the machine quarters... I
wonder how long it will take me to beat this?

Let's see.
