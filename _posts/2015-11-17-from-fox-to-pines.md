Well, [we finally did it][wedidit]: As of now, we have moved into our
new apartment in [Lindenwold, NJ][linden].

This has been a [long time coming][longtime]. We started working on
moving out in May, and finally clinched it only about one month
ago. <!-- more --> In that time, we've switched leases a few times
(and began paying more to stay where we were), nearly lost the
apartment we were staying in (due to a
[miscommunication][misunderstood]), and switched out one of the trio
of housemates (for the better, I am sure).

It's certainly [been a trip][longtrip]. To be honest, as I write this
we are still in the process of leaving the old
[apartment][peejeeapt]. This is our first unassisted [move][themove]
(the last time, our first [move][themove] at all, we had the help of
one of the parents), and it has taken us some time indeed to
[move][themove] all of our belongings to the new place. I finally got
my bed frame here last night (Though my mattress and I have been
sleeping here for over a week). Perhaps that's why I felt the need to
write this now.

This [move][themove] marks a new chapter in my life. I am leaving
behind an apartment that, to be honest, was actually pretty hard to
live in: I was sharing a room with someone, the other two people
didn't get along at all, and well... It was small and fairly
unmaintained. We chose it because of a [deadline][xkcdpiro] which
forced our hand: We needed a place to live, and *now*, or we would
effectively be [homeless][homeless]. So, we chose a place that was
cheap and livable, with no other criteria involved.

All of those problems were addressed with the new place. We had a long
list of things we wanted to have: A [gas range][castiron], a large
maintenance crew, a larger bathroom, a better kitchen, on the second
floor. We took our time, rejected a few places, and finally found one
that we liked enough to commit to for now.

And (hopefully) we'll stay here longer than we stayed at the last
place: I do not enjoy moving so much as to do it
[sesquiennially][sesqui] (nor will I be joining the semi-related
[linguistics club][xkcd]).

[wedidit]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBCw4_XgouA "It does seriously feel like a big accomplishment, finally being able to say we have a new apartment. It's expensive to move, but it was going to become more expensive (in both money and stress) to stay where we were. I am glad we got out, even if it does make things a bit tight."
[linden]: http://www.lindenwold.net/ "Moving to Lindenwold was interesting, mostly because of the reactions people gave me when I told them: I got a bunch of warnings about it being a hard place to live in, a place with a lot of crime and problems, and even a few that were *explicitly* racist, instead of just implicitly. Fun fact: Lindenwold is only less than 30 points ahead of Hi-Nella in terms of crime rate. That is less than 3 percent. It was, really, a pretty lateral move in terms of danger... But that didn't keep people from freaking me out because of the demographics that live here. Just sad, considering we are in 2015."
[longtime]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/05/15/stressing-productivity/ "When I wrote this, I thought 'the coming months' in the opening article were going to be 'June and July', not 'Summer and Autumn'... Or I would have said the coming seasons!"
[misunderstood]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Let_Me_Be_Misunderstood "They, for some reason, thought we were leaving in a month when I originally extended our lease. Unfortunately, that was not the case... But, they accepted this without complaint, and we made it through til now."
[longtrip]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truckin%27 "It's been such a hard time. I really do dislike moving: In the end, I am a homebody, a housewife, a hikikomori, a shut in. I don't like my home base being disrupted, even if it is for the good of the realm. But, sometimes we have to do things that we do not like, right?"
[peejeeapt]: http://www.somethingpositive.net "(NOTE: I WANTED TO INCLUDE A REFERENCE WHERE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS IN THE LINKED COMIC LEAVES, SAYING THEIR APARTMENT WAS SIMPLY A PLACE WHERE THEY HELD THEIR STUFF FOR 6 YEARS... BUT I COULDN'T FIND IT. NOT WANTING TO THROW THE REFERENCE AWAY, BUT NOT HAVING TIME TO READ THROUGH ~10 YEARS OF COMICS, I SIMPLY GIVE YOU THIS LINK TO THE MAIN SITE. ENJOY!)    At it's most basic (as said in the linked comic) an apartment is just the place where You keep Your stuff. George Carlin said that too. I live in mine far too intensely to only consider it that, but I still have to admit that the old place is no longer the same without all of our stuff in it."
[themove]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Move "I love the Move. They are one of my favorite rock bands. I am, and always have been, pretty into the whole Psychedelic Rock thing, especially when such music tells a story as well. There is a certain innocence and earnestness in well-done Psychedelic music. I dunno. Check them out."
[xkcdpiro]: http://www.xkcd.com/157/ "What a deadline it was. We, two twenty-somethings who'd never lived alone, were given one month to find a place to live and move all of our stuff. It was a generously strict deadline: We received a lot of help, and (something I am grateful for) still can count on people, but it was a *very* strict deadline. I can only say that that is probably the reason the other two assented to signing with our old complex."
[homeless]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSRCjG-VLk "This really is a loaded term. I like the way George Carlin frames it here: The problem is really 'houselessness'. I also agree with a lot of his problems with NIMBY. It's a stupid concept, really. If You want to be a hermit, go be a hermit. But if You want to live in and help a society, why are You against the things that help it survive and prosper being in Your 'backyard', which is really not your property at all?"
[castiron]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cast-iron_cookware "I cook with cast iron, almost exclusively (I also make casseroles and soups, and use slow cookers and woks). An electric range becomes problematic when You have a 20lb, roughly seasoned hunk of metal You are scraping and placing across it. A gas range was my big ticket item."
[sesqui]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sesquiennial "'Sesquiennially' - Occurring once ever 18 months, or 1.5 years."
[xkcd]: http://www.xkcd.com/1602/ "'Sesquiannually' - Occurring 1.5 times in 1 year, or 3 times in 2."
