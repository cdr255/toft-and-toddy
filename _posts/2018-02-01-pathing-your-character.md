I've run into having to explain character creation in Pathfinder to a
bunch of different groups, so I figured I would finally write a big
post describing my groups' process.

The basic steps are [outlined here][basic].

### 01. Character Concept

The first thing You need to do, though, is have a character
concept. It's important to have an idea of the kind of character You
might like to play, because it helps to guide Your decisions going
forward with the character creation. 

It can be as simple as 'A warrior', or as complex as 'A disgraced
noble who wants to clear his name by doing good deeds'. It shouldn't
be more than one or two sentences though, because that'll come during
character creation.

### 02. Attributes

Next, is Your attributes. I usually have my players do a 20 point
point-buy, which You can do without a problem using [this
calculator][pbcalc]. And [here's a good article][arrays] on maximizing
Your character's bonuses using a 20 point buy. If You're wondering
what the attributes say about Your character, [Paizo describes them
well here][attributes].

The reason I don't roll 3d6 in order (or any derivative of that),
especially for newcomers, is that it takes away player agency in favor
of adding randomness... Which is the opposite of what I like to do in
my games.

### 03. Class and Race

Once You have Your Attributes selected, You pick a [race][] and a
[class][]. Unlike some older games, there are no restrictions as to which
race can pick which class. You can pick any combination.

Generally, I suggest people pick a class first if they are stuck,
because otherwise You end up with a lot of Elven Wizards, Halfling
Rogues, Dwarven Clerics, Human Fighters, Gnomish Illusionists/Bards,
Half-Elven Rangers/Druids, and Half-Orc Barbarians. There's nothing
wrong with any of those, but there's no reason a Dwarf *has* to be a
Cleric. Picking the class first helps people avoid those stereotypes
influencing their decisions.

### 04. Skills

Once You have those picked, It's time for [Skills][]. This is a little
tricky for newcomers, just because it looks complex. To keep things
simple: At level 1, You get a certain number plus Your Int Bonus (say
4+2). That means You have 6 ranks to spend. 

You also have a few skills which Your class is generally good
at. These are Your class skills, and they get a +3 bonus if You have
spent at least one rank in them.

You can only spend as many ranks on a skill as You have levels, so the
most You can spend on a skill right now is 1. A simple way to quickly
spend them is to buy as many of Your class skills as You can. If You
don't just wanna do that, Good skills to spend on are [Perception][],
[Sense Motive][], and [Stealth][].

### 05. Feats

Next is [Feats][], which are simple enough. You get one at first level, an
extra one if You took a Fighter-based class, and an extra one if You
are human.

Feats are little traits that make Your character better at
something. Picking Feats is a hotly debated topic, so I can't give any
broad recommendations, but when all else fails [Toughness][] is never a
bad choice.

### 06. Equipment

Second to last is Your [Equipment][]. There are [Kits][] for most classes,
or that will work well with similar classes. I suggest buying those, a
[weapon][], some [armor][], and then looking at what You have left to
spend.

### 07. Details

Finally, looking at Your sheet, fill in any and all blanks. No bonus?
Write a Zero. Not able to be used? Type an &mdash;. This helps when
You are looking at Your sheet and Wondering what Your Swim Skill is,
only to find that You didn't fill it out because You spent no ranks on
it, and now Your character is drowning and everything sucks.

This is also when any details You skipped at the beginning get filled
in: What they look like, Where they're from, Who they worship, etc.

And there You go, all done! Easy as 1-2-3-4-5-6-7... I
know. But, it gets easier the more You do it. And You are all done
now! Congrats!

[arrays]: http://www.geekindustrialcomplex.com/articles/point-buy-arrays "This is a way to skip the fiddly bits of the point buy and still have a decently min-maxed character."
[basic]: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html#generating-a-character "Honestly, Paizo did a pretty decent job of describing things to newbies. But, it's always nicer to hear things from a friendly mouth."
[pbcalc]: http://webpages.charter.net/tedsarah/Pathfinder/utilities/pointBuyCalc.htm "This is an easy way to avoid the convoluted math of doing a point buy. Good if You don't wanna min-max and don't wanna worry too much about the mechanics."
[race]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/ "Pathfinder has a lot of nice races; if You are new, it might be best to stick with the 'core' races, though."
[class]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/ "This can take some time, especially if You include all of the archetypes available. As a newbie, I would ignore archetypes entirely."
[Skills]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ "Skills are a lot of book-keeping, but in the grand scheme of things it's fairly simple."
[Perception]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception "Perception lets You notice and find things."
[Sense Motive]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sense-motive "Sense Motive helps You tell when people are lying, and get a judge of people's intentions."
[Stealth]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth "Stealth is the defense You have against other's Perception. It's a good one to have, though it's harder to use in groups."
[Feats]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/ "Feats can take forever to pick, because there are so many. If You are stuck, check out one of the many guides online."
[Toughness]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/toughness-final/ "Toughness makes You tougher. Gives You more HP each level, including retroactively."
[Equipment]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/ "Shopping time! Make sure to roll Your  starting wealth; It's on Your class page."
[Kits]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits/#table-tools-kits "If there isn't one for Your class specifically, look at a few of them and pick one that fits Your character concept."
[weapon]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/ "No sense going on an adventure undefended, yeah?"
[armor]: https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/armor/ "You shouldn't adventure naked, either."
