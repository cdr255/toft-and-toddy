 were conceptualized before the first game.')

**tl;dr** - Monster Breeders are RPGs where the main character raises
  at least one creature as a main part of the game. There's a partial
  list below.
  
### What is the Monster Breeder Blog? ###
Well, one of my favorite kinds of video games to play is the "Monster
Breeder RPG." These are games that, as a core concept, allow the
player to raise a team of creatures, usually which grow over time, in
order to do battle or perform in some way. 

Many people have played one of the most popular (and one of the first)
games in this subgenre, [__Pok&eacute;mon__][poke] (or __Pocket
Monsters__), at least at one point in their lives. This is the kind of
game I am talking about here: Creatures that grow and learn as the
game goes on.

Unfortunately (and fortunately, for [Game Freak][freak]), while
there is a whole world of games in this very often overlooked genre,
most of them forever live in the shadow of __Pok&eacute;mon__, being
regarded as "Clones," "Ripoffs," or "Ghetto __Pok&eacute;mon__."

As this is one of my favorite genres of games (and as I am always
looking for new ways to interact with a relatively small and
overlooked genre) I have decided to start a blog about them. This is
that Blog.

 sketch of one of the main creatures in the Digimon Mythos,
 Gabumon. He and Agumon were the two starters of the first "Digimon
 World" Game.')


### What are some examples of Monster Breeder Games? ###
Here is a (very partial, off-the-top-of-my-head) list of some of the
more memorable games which will fall into this site's purview:

- [__Pok&eacute;mon__][poke] - Pocket Monsters, the game that all
  other Monster Breeders are compared to. Created by
  [Satoshi Tajiri][satoshi] and [Game Freak][freak], published by
  [Nintendo][nintendo] (and if You haven't heard of __Pok&eacute;mon__,
  I don't know how You found Your way here...).
  
- [__Digimon__][digi] - Digital Monsters, the (as I recall) second
  most popular Monster Breeding Franchise from the early days. Created
  by "[Akiyoshi Hongo][aki]," [Wiz Inc.][wiz], [Bandai][bandai], and
  [Toei Animation][toei].

- [__Monster Rancher__][mons] - Monster Farm, a series of games for
  Playstation where You could generate monsters by inserting different
  discs into the system. Created by [Tecmo Koei][tecmo].
  
- [__Jade Cocoon__][tamamayu] - The Legend of Tamamayu, just about my
  favorite console game of all time. Definitely in my top 5. Had one
  sequel, both playstation exclusives. Created by [Genki][genki] and
  [Katsuya Kond&#x041D;][katsuya].

- [__Magic Pengel__][pengel] - The Quest for Color, A very much
  overlooked game for the ps2. Has one oddly named sequel. Created by
  __Garakuda Studio__ and [Taito Corporation][taito], published in the
  US by [Agetec][agetec].

 Monster. Depicted are the TigerxTiger [blue], TigerxPixie [pink],
 TigerxZuum [green], and TigerxGolem [grey].')

### What exactly do You plan on talking about on this Blog? ###
First off, I want to give each and every game I own in this genre a
good-faith review. There is not enough of a murmur about some of these
games on the net, so I would like to add my mumbling to the mix.

Secondly, I want to talk about news concerning both the genre and the
series themselves, as well as anything else that may well impact
it. (I am crossing my fingers indefinitely for a __Jade Cocoon__ Movie
or Anime).

Thirdly, I want to Overthink and Overanalyse as many parts of these
games as I can. Part of the culture of these games is their immersive
universes, which allow for a degree of subtlety only rivaled by other
RPGs, and even then not all of them. I want to consider and talk about
the little things.

Fourthly, I want to compare and contrast the gaming mechanics of each
game I mention (eventually, very hard work). This is to give me and
other game designers perhaps a clearer view of what has and has not
worked in the past, and to reveal the seamy underside of the games to
those who wish to view it.

Finally, I just want to create and gather more content around these
games and their fanbases. I want to keep these games alive, well past
their last printings.

 the Main Character, Levant, sitting in the Forest... Probably the
 Spider Forest.')



### Anything Else? ###
Well, I am going to try my best to keep this blog on topic as much as
possible... but I make no promises in that regard. I am very good at
relating things, and even tangental relationships are good enough for
this blog, so yeah, expect a wide variety of content.

 cover of the OST to Magic Pengel. It shows many of the main
 characters in the game.')
