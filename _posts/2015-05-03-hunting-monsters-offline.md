This week, I ordered a new copy of [Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate][mh3u]
for the 3ds. My old copy was lost in the move last year, and with a
new move coming up in a couple months, I knew I had to get another
one (so I could lost it again).

I really like [Monster Hunter][mh], at its core. For those who haven't
played it, the series started on the [Playstation 2][ps2] and
continues to this day, with the newest installment being a
[3ds exclusive][3ds]. It is a [gear-based][gear] [ARPG][arpg], where
Your job is to hunt increasingly dangerous and deadly monsters in a
low-tech, no-magic fantasy land.

{% endraw %}

The gameplay is presented in [Quests][quests], which set up predefined
maps with a certain layout of items and monsters, and give You an
objective to complete in a [time limit][time]. Completing certain
quests unlocks others, and as You unlock more and more quests, the
challenges get [much more strenuous][difficultycurve]. But, the
[rewards][loot] get much better, too.

"Leveling" in this game is entirely based on the [gear][gear] that You
craft. As You progress in the game, You get more and more varied items
from which You can [craft][crafting] new armor, weapons, accessories
and items from, which effectively let You take and give much more in
battle. Which is all well and good... But I've noticed
something. Something I am sure many of You out their may have noticed
too, especially if You've spent any time in [Azeroth][wow] or
[Norrath][eq].

A lot of these things would not be out of place in an [MMO][mmo].

Now, I am [**not** a huge fan][xkcd] (or even a [small one][fnaffan])
of [MMOs][mmo]. Something about that combination of [kitsch][camp],
[social observance][social], and [endless, pointless grinding][grind]
just doesn't click with me. It just isn't something I enjoy to play,
though I am very much into other types of games that have these same
traits.

So, realizing this made me [go back and examine][examine] my
experiences with [MMOs][mmo], and I think I may have found the major
(for me) difference between them and  [Monster Hunter][mh].

I grew up playing some [MUDs][muds] online, alongside many, **many**
single player [jrpgs][jrpg] and [wrpgs][wrpg]. [MUDs][muds] are the
spiritual predecessors of [MMOs][mmo]: Entirely text based (or tile
based, in recent years) games where You explore a world with a
plethora of distinct areas with set enemies, and grind for experience
and gear in order to grow Your character alongside many, many other
people also playing the game.

But [MUDs][muds] avoid those three things I mentioned earlier, for the
most part. Most of the ones I frequented don't have glaring
[MUD][muds]-ness stamped onto every bit of scenery. The ones I've
played all take themselves fairly seriously, but don't lock You in
that way, either: They simply let You experience the world.

You can easily ignore the other players: Just don't look at or talk to
them (kind of like in real life) and they will mostly leave You alone
too. For scenes and quests important to Your character specifically
(like the intro level), You are taken out of the multiplayer section
and put in an area **without** a bunch of other people running around
being told they are **also** a [chosen one][neo] who is destined for
greatness.

When You want player interaction, the [MUDs][muds] I frequent all
[encourage][encrp] or [enforce][enfrp]. Which prevents that
[MMO-talk][mmotalk] from cropping up and being used, for the most
part.

And perhaps the biggest, most crucial difference (at least to me, and
in my experience): There is no [end game][mmo-end]. The game is over
when You get tired of playing and leveling the character, and doing
those things isn't just something to do in order to hit the level cap
and play end game.

And that is probably the biggest difference between [MMOs][mmo] and
[Monster Hunter][mh]. [Monster Hunter][mh] is a game of failure and
success. It is a game where You play to overcome challenges, prove
Yourself, and help other people in ways that aren't
[blatantly lame][lame]... It is a game about a **journey**, with a
clear end goal (beating the last, most difficult monster) that is
achievable if You are tenacious and determined enough.

[MMOs][mmo], on the other hand, are more about the
**destination**. You want to have this, get that, level this, beat
that. You'll suffer through a bunch of tedium and stress, not because
it is something You enjoy... but because of what You'll get
afterward. In an [MMO][mmo], You are more concerned about the things
You find than You are about the way that You find them.

Or at least that has been my experience. [YMMV][ymmv]!


[mh3u]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter_3_Ultimate "I am very happy to have gotten a copy of this game again. I've always had a great time with it, though I was never really able to appreciate the multiplayer before. Now, my close friends have the game, which makes this playthrough a whole new experience for me."
[mh]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter "This series is a great example of a simple idea (Hunting Monsters) being taken, fluffed out to a degree, and polished so well that it just **shines**. Other games that do a similar thing with a simple concept are Dark Souls (which is based around PVP combat), Nidhogg (Which is based around fencing), and Super Smash Brothers (Which is based around knocking Your opponent offscreen)."
[ps2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2 "The playstation two is one of the big consoles for me. It certainly feels like it has been around forever, though I recognize that it hasn't. I've played so many games on it, more than probably any other system (except computer, of course).. And because of its 100% backwards compatibility with the PSX, I rarely need to switch systems... Just memory cards."
[3ds]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS "Nintendo really hit the nail on the head with their handheld for the generation. It gave people exactly what we wanted (graphical improvements, Wireless Local and Online Play, Ability to get games Digitally as well as Physically) without running into many of the common problems of the day (Fully Backwards Compatible with the DS, Not completely focused on the 3D Gimmick, Wide and diverse library of games."
[gear]: http://www.rpgcodex.net/forums/index.php?threads/games-with-great-equipment-systems-best-loot-whoring-games.73071/ "Loot based RPGs are pretty interesting. The idea that, should Your equipment be stolen, break, or otherwise disappear You be trust right back to the start of the game power wise is an scary idea, but games rarely implement that as a possibility. And, by then, You'll have learned to play the game better, so I guess it is not totally true... at least for ARPGs."
[arpg]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game "I didn't play as many ARPGs growing up as I do now. I was more into the tactical side of things, and preferred TRPGs or JRPGs. Games like Jak and Daxter or Ratchet and Clank just didn't grab me."
[quests]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest_%28video_gaming%29 "One thing in modern games of all genres that is extremely over used is the idea of the quest. It is everywhere. I don't really have a problem with it, per say... But the concept really shouldn't be as omnipresent as it is. What happened to nonlinear gameplay?"
[time]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadline "A time limit, or a deadline, is a **great** way to add tension to something in a game. Implementing it is often tricky, because at the end of the day it is still arbitrarily shortening the game. Monster Hunter gets around this with its camp: You are part of a guild, a quest guild, that literally employ You. In other words, it is You **job** to do it in the time limit. Or You won't get paid."
[difficultycurve]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VideoGameDifficultyTropes "Games that truly get difficult, as opposed to merely powering up Your avatar as You go along, are much more fun to play. And, as someone who likes difficulty in games, I appreciate that the monsters in MH3U do in fact get more difficult as You play."
[loot]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2014/12/08/part-time "One thing I dislike in modern Tabletop Gaming, especially RPGs, is the Video Game creep. Don't get me wrong, I like crossbreeding... and it is an interesting idea to borrow certain concepts and make them work on the table. But, why are there MMO-like roles in DnD 4e, or 'Health Potions' in DnD Next?"
[crafting]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2015/02/27/millinery-industrial-complex "Crafting and Items are probably the two most interesting parts of games for me. My two most cherished Pathfinder characters that I have played before were Din, who was an alchemist (crafting, spells were even like crafting and could be traded with party), and Fulthar, who was a Pathfinder Chronicler (Who literally had a magic bag from which he could pull any item up to a certain money limit. Like a shop that he wore around his neck. And it replenished every level)."
[wow]: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18637509/ "I got to level 5 on my most recent foray into the World of Warcraft, before deciding that it still wasn't a game for me. I don't like the cartooniness of it, the game *literally* starts with the same busy work people complain about until You are at level cap, and I cannot understand how people are okay watching like 20 other people go in an kill the same thing You are going to kill as You leisurely jog towards the place in the distance."
[eq]: https://www.everquest.com/register "I honestly didn't know Everquest was still a thing. It was the first MMO I'd ever tried, and it also didn't grab me. I liked my MUDs better. But I suppose I should buckle down and give it another try one of these days."
[mmo]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game "Massively Multiplayer anything just doesn't really make me excited to play the game. But hey, if it is what You like, You do You. As someone once remarked to me when I was in High School and dressed as Woody Guthrie, after I admitted that I really liked Folk Music: 'I guess someone has to.'"
[xkcd]: https://xkcd.com/1378/ "Before You say anything, yes, I have actually tried them. Multiple games, multiple times. I actually got a little bit invested in Wakfu a while back, but as soon as the game got to the point where it dropped You into the same place as everyone else I lost interest."
[fnaffan]: http://steamcommunity.com/app/319510/discussions/0/616187839384430702/ "All three Five Nights at Freddy's games to date have had the desk fan as a motif. I wonder what it is about the fan that caused Scott Cawthorn to include it in the first place. I am sure there is a hilarious story."
[camp]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch#History "This is something that, I have to admit, Monster Hunter has in spades. It is very campy from start to finish... but perhaps because of the fact that it is just me there, and I (while being a product thereof) don't have to participate in the camp outside of some gestures, it doesn't bother me. It is almost like satire, in fact... Maybe that is the reason. I dunno."
[social]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraversion_and_introversion#Introversion "People play games to feel accomplished in one of three areas: Competence, or overcoming difficulty. Autonomy, or making Your own choices. And Relatability, or social interaction. Of the three, the area I tend to trend towards the least is Relatability. I am a big fan of playing alone (or, at best, with some people in the same room."
[grind]: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15700583723 "I actually am okay with grinding in other kinds of games. Perhaps the reason for that is that there isn't a plethora of people *telling* me to grind, nor is there a huge sign posted which demands I do so. If I grind in Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, or Pokemon, it is because I want to... not because I am forced to."
[examine]: http://www.eruptingmind.com/the-importance-of-examining-your-beliefs/ "It is important to constantly be reevaluating Your beliefs, especially Your long held beliefs. I read the following quote somewhere: 'Loyalty to petrified opinion never yet broke a chain or freed a human soul.' And that is fairly accurate."
[muds]: http://www.mudconnect.com/ "I still play MUDs, on occasion. I have recently started to play SINDOME, which is a cyberpunk, classless game that uses the SPECIAL system from Fallout as its base stats. Sort of like Shadowrun, but less RNG and more role play."
[jrpg]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games "There is no denying the impact Dragon Quest had on Role Playing Video Games, whether You like jrpgs or not. So many modern tropes in gaming got their start either there or in Final Fantasy... and that is pretty cool."
[wrpg]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Western_role-playing_video_games "Most people are familiar, at least in passing, with the term jrpg (I blame Pokemon). But they're usually not as familiar with wrpg, or Western Role Playing Game. That is, turn-based, non-tactical RPGs that are **not** jrpgs. Like Baldur's Gate."
[neo]: http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20040521 "This is a **big** distraction for me, when I try to play MMOs. I simply cannot enjoy the game when 500 other people are supposedly on the same exact quest as me. It cheapens the experience."
[encrp]: http://www.mudconnect.com/cgi-bin/adv_search.cgi?key_mode=PHRASE&base=NONE&String=.*&options=RP2 "I like these the best. It is nice to be allowed to break character if You get lost, or if You are frustrated with something, without needing to broadcast it to a channel."
[enfrp]: http://www.mudconnect.com/cgi-bin/adv_search.cgi?key_mode=PHRASE&base=NONE&String=.*&options=RP3 "These can be the most rewarding by far if You get invested. You are literally not allowed to break character unless You are on a very specific chat channel. It makes for a very in depth and interesting world, but requires a lot of commitment from the players."
[mmotalk]: http://www.mmoglossary.com/mmorpg_terms/1/index.html "I can understand most MMO babble pretty well, but I don't really like it. A genre of games doesn't really need its own jargon, at least not to that point, in my opinion... and even so, it just sounds so silly!"
[mmo-end]: http://www.engadget.com/2014/03/14/working-as-intended-endgame-is-the-worst-thing-that-ever-happen/ "The idea of an endgame like it exists in MMOs makes me sad. It basically invalidates the entire process of reaching the end of the game... especially when You can just throw money at them in order to reach it faster."
[lame]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2008/11/14 "How many times have we needed to collect mushrooms, or animal pelts, in video games? Should these *heroes* be doing something more important than errands for people too lazy to do their one job?"
[ymmv]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ymmv "Your mileage may vary. These are just my thoughts on the matter, on a blog about my thoughts on the matter. If You like MMOs, more power to You. If You hate Monster Hunter, I don't care, go for it. Just discussing what is on my mind."
