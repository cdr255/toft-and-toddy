Early Music Time!

Today, I have a selection from [Orchesographie][orch] that I first
heard [Nancy Hurrel][nancy] play at
a [Somerset Harp Festival][somerset]: __Bransle Des Hermites__, or __The
Hermit's Bransle__.

A [Bransle][bransle] is a circle dance where the nobles of the
[Renaissance][renaissance] would "pretend" to be things or people
other than nobles. In this one, they pretend to be "Hermits"- that is,
religious hermits, or monks.

The dance is a fairly simple one: Two steps left, two right, two left,
two right, turn around while kicking four times and bow while crossing
Your arms on Your chest, turn while kicking again, and bow again. You
are meant to step larger on the left steps, and shorter on the right:
This is so the circle can go around fully during the song. And once it
goes around once, the dance is over.

As for the piece, it was written in the key of [G Dorian][gdor], and
(as You can see) was in [Mensural Notation][mensural] (which was
common at the time). I have transcribed it (using
[GNU/Lilypond][lilypond]) in both a cleaner
[mensural notation][mensuralclean] and a [modern][modernclean].

I'll also be playing and recording it soon, on my
[soundcloud][soundcloud], so be on the look out for that! I'll embed
it here when it's out.

[orch]: http://imslp.org/wiki/Orch%C3%A9sographie_%28Arbeau,_Thoinot%29 "This book and Danseyre are the two most popular surviving manuscripts when it comes to dancing manuals. Both have music (in mensural notation) and the steps for each dance written out, and of the two, Orchesographie is the most readily available to the layman (like myself)."
[nancy]: http://www.hurrellharp.com/ "Nancy Hurrel was the first actual person I ever met who studied this kind of music, and ever since I have admired it greatly. I have her to thank for introducing me to the harp as an Early Music instrument, and for many of the important words (like Orchesographie and Bransle) that I have used to fuel my studies."
[somerset]: http://www.somersetharpfest.com/ "Somerset is a wonderful weekend for Harp, and I wish I could set aside the money to go again every year. I'll make it back eventually, but I need to get myself on my feet first! If You play harp (especially lever harp) You owe it to Yourself to attend this convention at least once. And bring Your harp!"
[bransle]: http://www.pbm.com/~lindahl/del/sections/bransles.html "This word is pronounced like we pronounce the word 'brawl' in the modern English world. They, along with Pavanes and a few others, form the backbone of renaissance courtly dances (especially for beginners) at least in my experience."
[renaissance]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Renaissance "The Renaissance period has a *lot* of surviving material for Musicians and Artists to study, at least when in comparison to the Medieval period. It is also the largest section of Early Music. And, when I say 'Renaissance', I specifically mean the years 1450 - 1600 CE in Western and Central Europe."
[gdor]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorian_mode "The Second Mode of the Major Scale, the Dorian Mode is one of the most used Modes in Early Music. It has a darker and starker tone than the Aeolian (or Natural Minor) Mode. It's still used a *lot* today, especially when it comes to melody or soloing."
[mensural]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensural_notation "Mensural Notation is call that because of the Latin word 'mensus', which was used in a few terms by early Musical Theorists. It means 'measured', 'estimated', or 'distributed'."
[lilypond]: http://www.lilypond.org/ "I use GNU/Lilypond to compose all of my original pieces, and also to quickly create sheet music or midi for a piece which I am teaching someone. It compiles to Modern and Mensural Notation, as well as Tablature for all manner of string instruments and MIDI."
[mensuralclean]:  https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/bransle-des-hermites-mensural.png "This is mostly for curiousity's sake. If You actually want to learn to read mensural notation, there are tutorials and rules outlined online (Google knows where). If You just want to learn the piece, I would use the modern version instead."
[modernclean]: https://s3.amazonaws.com/toft-and-toddy/bransle-des-hermites-modern.png "This is simply the melody in the key of G Dorian. Feel free to arrange this as You like, all I did was read the mensural notation from the facsimile presented above and encode it in GNU/Lilypond. And the facsimile is from the 1500s, so it is in Public Domain."
[soundcloud]: https://soundcloud.com/cdr255/ "Follow me on Soundcloud and I'll follow You back! I upload both recordings of stuff I am working on, and MIDI versions of my original compositions as they are completed and posted. I don't upload very often, but I am trying to post more than I have been."
