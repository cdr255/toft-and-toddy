I'm [moving][movinout] in the next few months.

That means finding a new apartment, breaking everything down, packing
everything up, and actually getting it moved into the new place. Lots
of work, but then, [moving always is][movework]. Nothing special there.

But I *do* have some kind of [anxiety][anxiety] about it, I think. I
dunno if it is only in my own head, or it is something I actually am
noticing as being stressful... but there is no arguing that I am
worried about it. It's in my nature, I suppose.

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

But I am trying my best not to let this [high anxiety][sugaranxiety]
stop me in my tracks.

I had a really good [posting streak][archive] going on there for a
while: two full weeks of daily posts. While I don't want a
[regular schedule][about] on this blog, I do want it to be fairly
active... so I was [proud][pride] of that, on some level. Had I
existed in a vacuum, I am sure I would have kept that up forever.

But things got [overwhelming][overwhelm] last Friday, and I ended up
taking the weekend off.

There is a lot of work that goes into these posts: With the title text
included, each one is well over [3000 words][wpm] long... and I try my
best to find a bunch of interesting links to pepper throughout the
text, which (while not stressful) does take a good amount of time. I'm
not complaining; if I didn't want to put in the work, I wouldn't do
it.

But when things get [difficult][difficult], I will probably miss a
post here or there.

I'd rather do that than [burn out][burnout] on other things, or write
[sub par][xkcd] posts. [Hexo][hexo] makes maintaining drafts and the
site so easy, also, that I don't expect these breaks to come very
often. But they **will** come.

My truancy **did** allow me to be productive in areas I otherwise
would not have been: I was able to write a
[new piece of fiction][gammon], for instance, because the inspiration
hit me at the time. I also got a lot of organization done, even
outside of the [life work][life] I had to do as well. I took some time
out to honor my Aunt on [Mother's Day][mother].And I was able to take
some time for myself, to decompress and [relax][relax].

Being [productive][productive] is very important to my emotional
well-being when I am [stressed out][stress]: If I am not getting
anything done while dealing with life, then I get depressed... which
feeds into itself, because then I
[don't want to do anything][do nothing].

My Aunt always called me a "[Human Doing][humando]" because of that
facet of my personality: I need to be doing something at all
time. Just being makes me itchy and nervous. I suppose that hasn't
changed, even while I have come of age... But it means that, if I
[burn out][burnout] too fast, then everything [hits the fan][fan].

There are a lot of changes coming to my life, soon. I'm sure I'll
share [some of them][privacy] here, and those I do (I hope) will be
interesting. But I will also probably miss some days here and there,
and I wanted to address it now: I may [disappear][disappear] here and
there, but I will almost always be working on something.


[movinout]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJtL8vWNZ4o "I've never really been a huge fan of Billy Joel, but this song in particular always gets stuck in my head for some reason. I do like how his songs tend to have a lot of little vignettes, kind of like Jethro Tull. But then, he doesn't really stand out much to me... kind of like Joe Jackson. I dunno."
[movework]: http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1587 "Moving is mostly a lot of work because of the packing and unpacking. I've never really minded moving boxes; Lifting heavy things and putting them back down isn't too hard or long, just tedious. And if You are doing it in a group, it is no problem at all, because of conversation."
[anxiety]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety "I have recently noticed exactly how anxious I have been getting as of the last year or two. I have always had a good amount of social anxiety, but in the last few years it really seems to have gotten a bit worse... Or maybe I am just confronting it a bit better (and more regularly)."
[sugaranxiety]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCEk0YBh9g4 "One of the bands my dad introduced us to as kids was Sugar Ray. Most people I've run into have only really heard them once they made the shift to being a Top 40 pop band, but I remember clearly a time when they only had Fly as a soft song, and were mostly a hard rock/nu metal band. This song was on the same album as Fly, and kinda shows how versatile they were until they found something that made them a good amount of money and stuck with it."
[archive]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/archives/ "I was extremely happy with my 14 day streak there, and I would love to do something like that again. This past week has let me build up a decent buffer again, though as I say on the about page (and in the next title-text) I don't really want to commit to a regular schedule. This is more of a side project for me anyway."
[about]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/about/ "I updated the about page to specifically reflect the scheduling with the new blog, but then I updated it again for this post, to be more specific about my lack of scheduling."
[pride]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride "I take a lot of pride in my work, even for little things like this blog and these posts. I struggle constantly with living up to my own expectations, and oftentimes fall short of doing so... So, when I actually do something how I feel it should be done, I feel a lot of pride with how everything went. And when it's something that can end and go back to disappointing me, I suppose it hits me all the harder when it does (like it did)."
[overwhelm]: http://zenhabits.net/a-simple-guide-to-being-present-for-the-overworked-and-overwhelmed/ "One things that I have always tried to work on in my life is actually being present in the current moment. When I get to working, one of the flaws I definitely share with people like Tony Stark is that I get some serious tunnel vision... and that combines with my anxiety and overactive mind to make me stress out about the past and the future a LOT, especially when it comes to work."
[wpm]: http://www.forbes.com/sites/brettnelson/2012/06/04/do-you-read-fast-enough-to-be-successful/ "I want to take this title-text to specifically call out the fact that I read... very... slowly... especially when I am enjoying or learning something from whatever I am reading. My speed is something like 200 wpm, which is 50 under the average for American adults. And the numbers in this study say to me that, contrary to what they claim, a lot of the 'successful people' who read so much are really either skimming or lying about the amount they read... (Or, I suppose they could also have enough free time to actually get it done, if they are uber-successful)."
[difficult]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czY9kWNXDDI "As a musician, I find Metalocalypse to be hilarious. As a bassist, I think Murderface is a combination of all of the negative stereotypes associated with bassists brought to life, and (so long as it is clear that it is as much a joke as Pickles' alcoholism, party animal persona, and general idiocy are) think he's hilarious."
[burnout]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnout_%28psychology%29 "Pacing myself is something I never was very good at. I tend to throw myself fully into something until I can no longer do so, and then give it a rest for a bit before I start again straight away. I burn myself out a lot. While I *do* recognize it is something I should work on, that will be something very difficult to change about myself."
[xkcd]: http://www.xkcd.com/1313/ "I looked for the comic I wanted for this link for a LONG time, and eventually settled for a golf reference in a regex joke. Whoopsie!"
[hexo]: http://hexo.io/ "I cannot stress how much Hexo has improved my productivity when it comes to blogging. I am in the process now of switching Prose and Prosody over to Hexo as well (at least locally; still on Blogger until Heroku settles on a price model), and I have no complaints about any of the upkeep of the blog. Check it out if You can."
[gammon]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/2015/05/gam-02-xiksa-in-castlegate.html "Fun fact about Gammon: As You can see in the link for this piece, the female lead was originally called 'Xiksa', which was pronounced 'Jiksah'. Upon a friend's (Rachel's) suggestion tho, I changed her name to 'Xiska'... both for story reasons and because 'Xiksa' is too close to the Jewish term 'Shiksa', which has negative connotations."
[life]: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/80843/what-does-life-gets-in-the-way-mean "Grammatically, saying that life gets in the way makes no sense. Anything You do is really a part of Your life, in that sense of the term... so how can it get in the way of itself? But still I find myself using it, because it is a good metaphor for 'something more pressing came up'."
[mother]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day "It's interesting that Mother's Day is a fairly new holiday. Something to note, I suppose, especially when You are a part of a generation where it has always been an established holiday."
[relax]: http://www.somethingofthatilk.com/index.php?id=91 "Unfortunately, I definitely exhibit this vice in my day to day. Even when I am done working for the day, many of my nights are still spent on this same Dell Latitude E4300 running Slackware Linux 14.1, playing MUDs, roguelikes, dwarf fortress, or other games."
[productive]: https://xkcd.com/874/ "One of my friends once commented (jokingly) that this comic was about me: I would wake up, blog, and fuck around for the rest of the day. It hurt me for a while, until I realized it was meant in kindhearted jest."
[stress]: http://www.stress.org/stress-effects/ "Stress is something that has effected and affected my life so fully that, when my Aunt visited Cancun without us when I was a child, she brought back masks as souvenirs for us: My brother got the mask for Joy, and I, of course, got the one for Worry."
[do nothing]: http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3676 "It's interesting to think about how life would be different if we actually had some proof (other than our sentience) that we were important in the grand scheme of things. How much would, really, be different? Would we work less... or more? Would we still lie, cheat, and steal? Interesting thought experiment."
[humando]: http://truetao.blogspot.com/2009/05/human-being-or-human-doing.html "I have been, and probably always will remain, a human doing before anything else. I simply enjoy being productive more than I do consuming: Being able to look back on something, and say that I did *this* with my time... That is one of the finest joys in my life. And there is nothing wrong with that, now that I am an adult."
[fan]: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/21860/whats-the-etymology-of-when-the-sht-hits-the-fan "I am not entirely sure how accurate these responses are, but upon examining the roots of the phrase, I certainly found them entertaining... particularly the anecdote."
[privacy]: https://www.eff.org/wp/blog-safely "I hope that, in my lifetime, we as a culture can move past being able to be fired for posting something inappropriate on the internet. The idea that what I do in my free time can cost me a job I have flipping burgers or filing papers is reprehensible to me."
[disappear]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheHermit "I love my solitude. It is when I get the most and best work done, when I am alone. When people are around, I have this urge to be a good host and entertain them... So I tend not to get as much work done, then."
