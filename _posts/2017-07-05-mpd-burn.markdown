I spent 4 hours yesterday setting up a quick way to take my [MPD][mpd]
playlists (which are in simple [M3U][m3u]) and burn them to a number
of audio CDs in [K3B][k3b] (which only
accepts [extended M3U][extm3u]). I use [Slackware][slackware], so I
had [KDE][kde] preinstalled, which is why I used the programs I did. I
might eventually adapt the following script to work with other
programs as well.

Required programs include the following (most of which come stock in
Slackware):

### Independent Packages
* [GNU Bash][bash] (or equivalent)
* [GNU Coreutils][coreutils]
* [MPC][mpc]
* [MPD][mpd]
* [perl][perl]

### From [KDE][kde]
* [k3b][k3b]
* [kdialog][kdialog]

You **need** to set `save_absolute_paths_in_playlists` to `"yes"` in
`mpd.conf` for this script to work. It also assumes You follow
FreeDesktop's [XDG User Directories][xdg] defaults and keep Your music
in `~/Music`.

I straight up lifted the current-playlist-to-extm3u-markup oneliner
from [here][oneliner]. 

This script *does* create a file in the CWD, but it also asks if You'd
like to remove it. I did this because, at times, I may want to keep
the generated playlist for importing into other. If this bothers You,
You'll have to modify the flow of the script. 

You can also download the script from my [github repo][scriptsrepo].

~~~ bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

echo "Opening Current MPD playlist in k3b for burning...";

currtime=$(date +"%F_%T");

echo \#EXTM3U > $currtime-mpdburn-playlist.m3u;

mpc -f "##EXTINF:%time%,%artist% - %title%\n~$HOME/Music/%file%" playlist | perl -F: -p -e 'if (/^#EXTINF/) {$sec=$F[1]*60; $F[2] =~ s/(^.+),/$1/; $sec += $F[2]; s/^.+,(.+)/#EXTINF:$sec,$1/;}' >> $currtime-mpdburn-playlist.m3u;

k3b --audiocd $currtime-mpdburn-playlist.m3u --nosplash

kdialog --yesno "Delete Temporary Extended-M3U playlist?" 

if [ "$?" == 0 ]; then
    echo "Okay, Deleting $currtime-mpdburn-playlist.m3u"
    rm -v $currtime-mpdburn-playlist.m3u;
elif [ "$?" == 1 ]; then
    echo "Okay, Keeping $currtime-mpdburn-playlist.m3u"
else
    kdialog --error "Unexpected Choice."
