Recently, my brother got me back into [Dark Souls][darksouls]. Shortly
after, we managed to get my best friend into it, too. So, there's been
a lot of [Dark Souls][darksouls] being played at my place
lately. Which got me thinking.

Just __what__ about this game made me like it so much?

Those who know me well know I am not exactly a *HUGE* fan of modern
video gaming: If the graphics are too "good," I get a headache from
looking at it... I still play NES, Genesis, SNES, Gameboy and MS-DOS
games on a regular basis... And while I enjoy a lot of the more modern
efforts, I feel as though there has been a shift in soul from the
games of 10-15 years ago.

I could make a metaphor for it (say what happened to Rock Music around
the end of the 70's), proselytize about it for a while, and waste this
space here... Or, I could simply leave it there. Because, I don't want
to talk about that today. Instead, I want to talk about
[Dark Souls][darksouls].

There are two main things which draw me to games like
[Dwarf Fortress][df], [Ys][ys], and [ADOM][adom], Those are:

1. High Difficulty

2. Implicit Storytelling

I'll talk about my love of games with insane difficulty some other
time. Instead, I'd like to focus on the second idea today: __Implicit
Storytelling__, or telling a story using things other than exposition
and dialogue.

In [Dark Souls][darksouls], You are given what amounts to 5 minutes of
direct exposition: And that includes a [genesis story][genesis], a
small amount of dialogue from a dying character ([Oscar][oscar]), and
then confirmation from a character near the
[start of the game][crestfallen].

All that does is tell the player what they are supposed to be doing,
with the smallest amount of story behind it. Everything else in the
story is left for the player to glean from "Talk"-ing to NPCs, reading
item descriptions, item drops and locations, and the dialogue-less
boss intro cut scenes.

There are many benefits to this, but first and foremost is that it
doesn't __force__ the player to hear the entire story. There are
players out there who are content knowing what they are supposed to
do, [without caring about why][gabe]. And on certain days, I don't
want to spend 30 minutes of the hour I have to play games watching a
movie or reading a book.

Another benefit: It makes the story one of the many ways a good game
can [reward exploration][das]. If the player wants to learn more about
the world, then having the setting, history, or story itself be told
in item descriptions makes every item worthwhile (no matter how hard
it is to find or collect).

On top of that, it makes the world seem more like a living, breathing
place... and less like a play, or a movie. In real life, only
[rarely][life] are we told all about some particular event, happening,
or custom. Usually, we need to find out about it on our own. And,
since we have computers and libraries, we usually end up reading about
it before anything else.

So, while it is still video game-y to make a key or a helmet tell You
about some person or event in history, it __seems_ more
real... Because it uses a method of discovery we are already familiar
with.

I don't want this to be too long a post, so I'll leave it at this: I
love [Dark Souls][darksouls] for many reasons. But I think the first
and foremost is how beautifully it uses __Implicit Storytelling__ to
tell its story. It does it so masterfully, that as a whole the
[Dark Souls][darksouls] community has been able to (semi-reliably)
piece together a lot of the back-story of the world of __Lordran__
without being told much at all.

And it did it so well that I noticed how much I enjoy it when a game
can do that, too.

[darksouls]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls "Seriously, it is rare that a modern, AAA game like this grabs me as much as Dark Souls has. I am 100% invested in it, at the moment."
[df]: http://dwarffortresswiki.org/ "In Dwarf Fortress, You make the world each time You play (using a random world generator)... But the point still stands, because the only way to learn about the resulting world is through implicit storytelling."
[ys]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_%28series%29 "Ys, as a series, *mostly* falls into these two categories... though it is much more focussed on the difficulty than the storytelling. For instance, the first game has a notebook which tells You all about each character You meet."
[adom]: http://www.ancardia.com/ "ADOM is a roguelike with a defined overworld, but random dungeons. As such, there is plenty to learn about the world around You as You play the game, while never quite being the same each time You play."
[genesis]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkmsJfMoM58 "I should digress and say that games with an origin story as their opening movie tend to be games that I like. Jade Cocoon for instance."
[oscar]: http://darksouls.wikidot.com/oscar-knight-of-astora "Well, his name *is* Oscar, even if that wasn't in the final copy of the game. Also, what is it about dying people and giving out helpful information?"
[gabe]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/10/07 "I rarely play games like this. Growing up with jRPGs and Text Adventures, I enjoy a good bout of exposition. But I admire when a game doesn't *need* one."
[das]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOX5bZcnyKw "The way that the first Legend of Zelda rewarded exploration is very present in Dark Souls, though the 'story' of the game was not part of it."
[life]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2006/04/10 "Outside of lessons and schooling, when most people *try* to tell us about something, there is usually a healthy dose of skepticism, too."
