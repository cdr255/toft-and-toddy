Here we go again!

I am Christopher Rodriguez, starting yet another blog because the old
incarnation of this site (Which will be imported by the time You are
reading this, and available for Your perusal below) looked both
amatuerish and was clunky to update.

I am now using [hexo](hexo.io), a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) based
blogging platform, to generate this site. This is because:

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}
 
- It is entirely CLI based (or at least, it seems that way right now)
- It is fast to generate and fast to publish
- It supports [Markdown][markdown], [YAML][yaml], and [Heroku][heroku]
  out of the box
- It lets me use [GNU/Emacs][emacs]
- It looks and feels modern and complete
- It does exactly what I need it to, and gets out of the way

I keep a journal. I have a fiction blog I have been updating for the
last month or so. I have a personal website, and **way** too many
social media profiles. But I still have a desire to share my projects
and work on a semi-regular basis in long form, and have that shared
content be preserved over the long term.

Hence, this site.

I'll write an **About** page later with some more specifics, but
basically this is a personal blog for me to use to both share and
document the work I do in my "day to day". This'll be everything from
composing, to programming, to fixing computers, to playing games.

I hope that the tag system lives up to its name!
