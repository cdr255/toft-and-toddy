**tl;dr:** _I've been playing Advance Wars II lately, and want to
  share the way I set up my computer to play it._

[![The Start of Our Battle](http://i.imgur.com/IPdq9at.jpg
'My opponent was Collin; I was Sensei. They immediately attempted to
flood the map with Mech and tank units, trying to etch out an early
victory through the relative cheaper costs they have for
units. I held firm, edging out my forces with a good amount of
paratroopers, holding the line in the center of the map. Here, it
could go either way.')](http://i.imgur.com/IPdq9at.jpg)

So, last Saturday my Brother was in town and we played Advance Wars
II.

I really like this game, as it is a fun, simple-to-grasp Turn Based
Strategy game that allows hotseat play. The various characters You can
choose from are interesting, and each one affords a different set of
strategies than all of the others. Add to that the fact that it
supports 4 players and has a built-in map editor, and it's easy to see
why it is one of my favorite games on the Gameboy Advance.

Here, though, I am not playing it on my Gameboy Advance... I am
instead playing it on my computer, and on my Widescreen Television.

'I was able to hold the line long enough to set up some Missles to
weaken their strong offensive force. They then started to bring in a
few of their own long range units, but it was too late: as soon as
they moved into range, I was able to fire on them, crippling their
efficacy. From that point on, I only needed to slowly march forward,
taking cities as I went to enhance my paratroopers landing range, and
then take out all of their units. Victory was
mine.')](http://i.imgur.com/VxLvxGJ.jpg)

I own a copy of the game, and was able to produce a ROM image of it
for my own personal use. This, I loaded using
[VisualBoy Advance][vba], which is available for both Windows and
GNU/Linux. I then was faced with a decision, because I wanted to have
it ready that very night: How am I going to unlock more than the 4
starting characters?

Well, I eventually came to the conclusion that I was going to use a
code. See, while the game itself doesn't have an 'unlock everything'
code, there existed for the GBA a few systems like the Game Genie
which allowed people to alter the code of the game. One was Gameshark,
the other was Codebreaker. (NB. I use these as the only examples
because that is what VisualBoy Advance has support for.)

I decided to go with Codebreaker. Below are the Codebreaker codes to
put in to unlock all characters and all costumes.

    00009E1F 000A
	1006FD98 0007
	8202805A FFFF
	8202805C FFFF
	8202805E FFFF

Just copy that and paste it into the emulator, and all of the COs are
unlocked, allowing for tournament play that very same day.

The only remaining question then is: Who will win?

Let's see.
