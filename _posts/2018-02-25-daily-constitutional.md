So, I've recently restarted my [daily constitutional][] routine.

A constitutional, in the way I'm using the word here, is a daily
outside walk meant to aid Your constitution―that is, Your
health. Whether that's physical health, mental health, emotional
health, or spiritual health is up to the person doing the
walking. It's a habit I picked up from some [Romantic period][] and
[Transcendentalist][] authors (Specifically [Wordsworth][] and
[Coleridge][], and [Emerson][] and [Thoreau][]).

I'd fallen off the habit in January; All at once I was dealing with a
depressive episode spurred by my current living situation, a pair of
skin issues that made physical activity unpleasant, and a burn out
from trying to exercise too heavily too quickly. Not a good scene,
really. It was kind of a hard month for me.

So, I cut the diet back, took some time off from my constitutionals
and weight lifting, and focused on my [emotional health][] for a
while. I've decided I'd like to move out to Pittsburgh. I saw my
doctor and made sure I'm taking care of myself. I got closer to a lot
of my friends.

And today, the 25th of February, I finally started doing my
constitutionals again.

It feels so good to be outside again, back among the trees and
puddles. Walking without a specific purpose other than to specifically
[be there, now][beherenow], is something I both treasure greatly in my
life… and something that it's easy for me to forget about, once I no
longer regularly indulge in it.

I did choose to play some music as I walked, but I didn't bring my
headphones, so it was quiet and in my pocket the whole time. If I'm
going to listen to music while I walk, this is my favorite way to do
it―provided there's no other people around. If there's a crowd where
I'm walking, I prefer headphones for sure.

The song I chose today was one that's very important to me: [Close to
the Edge][], by [Yes][]. In the introduction to the first movement,
there's a layering of "environmental tape" sounds collected by [Jon
Anderson][]―Bird chatter, rushing water, wind noises, all mixed together
to fade well into the chaotic opening of the piece. It's something I
want to emulate in some of [my own pieces][], when I finally record them.

I chose the song when, listening around me as I left my car, I was
struck by the sounds around me: the rains were calming down, but the
little rivers they left behind in the distance played off of the birds
anxiously anticipating spring in the trees bordering the park. The
combination made me think twice about putting on music at all, but
clinched which song I'd listen to, in the end. It was very powerful,
to me.

I also stopped to take some photos using [my phone][], which I have up on
Imgur, now. As usual, they fail to really capture the experience of
walking out among these scenes… But I still enjoy how they came out.

I think my biggest mistake with regard to my constitutionals was my
change to consider it to be "[cardio][]" to supplement my workouts. I
benefit most from these walks through the experience, rather than from
the exercise the experience provides. While I do enjoy the fact that
it's good for my physical health, I definitely benefit from it more in
my emotional, mental, and spiritual health. Physical is at the bottom
of the list.

For a few weeks before I'd stopped, I'd been [sleeping so late][] in the
day that I'd get up and rush out to the park after the sun had already
set. I'd power through a quick and fast walk in order to get some
cardio in. Stopping to look around me, or be here now, was out of the
question―not just because it was too dark for me to see anything, but
also because it would have slowed my pace too much.

That pretty much killed them, for me. They became a chore I slogged
through, instead of a habit I cherished. Something I'll have to keep
in mind, going forward.

I highly recommend incorporating constitutionals into Your daily
routine, if You can do so safely. Even if You get something completely
different out of them from me, I'm sure You won't regret having taken
time out to just be outside.


[daily constitutional]: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/13717/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-phrase-the-morning-constitutional "I love this pun, actually."
[Romantic period]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism "I like the Romantic period for its reconnective and natural aspects, more than its horror."
[Transcendentalist]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism "I'm mostly only familiar with Emerson and Thoreau from Transcendentalism. Something I hope to change soon."
[Wordsworth]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Wordsworth "William Wordsworth is one of the few poets I've memorized poems from."
[Coleridge]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge "Coleridge's big poems are gone over in school. I'd like to read more soon."
[Emerson]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "I prefer Emerson to Thoreau, because he was much more cohesive and congruent in his thinking. Some say it's because he talked a lot and didn't put his thoughts into practice, but I think he just thought things through more."
[Thoreau]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau "I like Thoreau. One of my life goals used to be to emulate Walden Pond myself; Now, I'm more interested in finding Walden nearby my normal lodgings, but it influenced me a lot."
[emotional health]: https://positivepsychologyprogram.com/emotional-health-definition-mike-oppland/ "I've been focussing a lot on not ignoring my more negative facets. I'm also trying to share my feelings more with those important to me—something I've been trying to learn for a while."
[beherenow]: https://www.amazon.com/Be-Here-Now-Ram-Dass/dp/0517543052 "The book I'm referencing here was very formative for me."
[Close to the Edge]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_to_the_Edge "This is seriously one of my favorite pieces of music. I have it on Vinyl, even. I could write a whole post just about it."
[Yes]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band) "Yes is my overall favorite progressive band, surpassed as time passes by Jethro Tull."
[Jon Anderson]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Anderson "I'm the only person I know who really enjoys Jon Anderson's lyrics as well as his vocals. I find a lot of meaning in the things he says, even if many people consider it to be gibberish."
[my own pieces]: http://cdr255.com/compositions/ "I have yet to actually take one of my pieces and record myself playing it on a real instrument. Something I hope to do once I live alone."
[my phone]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_V20 "I'm very happy with my LG V20, overall. Only issue is that there's a lot of interference that gets picked up through the bluetooth."
[cardio]: https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/sclark85.htm "I love cardio, when I'm working out. That tired feeling You get when You are done makes me feel very accomplished. But that's not what I do constitutionals for—if it were, I'd be using a treadmill and running."
[sleeping so late]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2018/01/24/noninstant-oatmeal/ "It was really hard for me to notice just how much I'd retreated into an unhealthy lifestyle. I like staying up late, but sleeping until 1800 is a bad sign when You go to bed around 0400."
