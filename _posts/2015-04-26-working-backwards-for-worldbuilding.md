Yesterday was a very busy day for me, but I did have a small epiphany
of sorts.

See, one thing I have been struggling with lately is the concept of
[Worldbuilding][worldbuilding]. I want my projects (be they games,
writing, or music) to have enough thought put in them to make them not
only likable, but believable. I want to create something like the
things which inspire *me*, and one thing they have in common with each
other is that they have beautiful, well-designed worlds for their
stories to play out in.

I also am something of a [Dungeon Master][dm] (or I [was][esoterica],
anyway)... and worldbuilding is extraordinarily helpful in that area.

<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

However, unlike creating a believable and unique
[character][charactersheet], I have found it difficult to destill the
process of making a world into a text-based form. There are just *so
many* different directions You can go from start that I doubt I could
finish this project without a lot of effort and wasted time... And
that is what I have been doing, the last few days. Wasting time.

But then, yesterday, I had an [idea][tweet]: What if I worked backwards? I
do that more often than not, especially when coming up with big ideas
or solving complex problems. Walking the path from the end to the
start is something I find invaluable in my day to day life, so why
*wouldn't* it work here?

Instead of coming up with the *questions* needed to make believable
and interesting *worlds*, why not use some of my favorite *worlds* to
come up with the needed and important *questions*?

Sometimes [the simplest answer][comic] is the right one, even when it
doesn't use the tools in front of You. This is one of those times, I
think.

So, expect to see some analyses of my favorite worlds here soon. I've
made You a small list, too! (Not by any means comprehensive, but I
want to cover all of these eventually).

Here You go:

  - **Syrus** ([Jade Cocoon][jc])
  - **Lordran** ([Dark Souls][ds])
  - **The Drakalor Chain, Ancardia** ([ADOM][adom])
  - **Emelan** ([The Circle of Magic][cm])
  - **Dragaera** ([Khaavren Romances][kv], [Vlad Taltos][vt])
  - **Legaia** ([The Legend of Legaia][ll])
  - **EXA_PICO** ([Ar Tonelico][at])
  - **Ivalice** ([Tricky][iv]: __Final Fantasy Tactics, Final Fantasy Tactics Advance, Final Fantasy XII, et al.__)
  - **Fa'Diel** ([The Legend of Mana][lm])
  - **Thedas** ([Dragon Age][da])



[worldbuilding]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldbuilding "This is basically the process of building a believable fictional world."
[dm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamemaster "I much prefer the term Dungeon Master to Game Master. Game Master is hard to say, hard to type, and sounds derpy. And GM is a company."
[esoterica]: http://cdr255.com/eote-adventure-log-1.html "This is the log of an adventure I ran about a year ago with some friends. I only have two parts up on my site, but it was a lot of fun."
[charactersheet]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2014/12/21/character-details/ "I made a post about my character detail sheet here. There is a superior GNU/Emacs version on the blog, and the .doc is on my site."
[tweet]: https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/592160434871992320 "I follow back! Mostly, I tweet about what I am doing during the day. I average around 3-5 tweets per day."
[comic]: http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=20100120 "As someone who's played a lot of MUDs, text adventures, and point and clicks over the years, I am all too familiar with this trapping of my mind."
[jc]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Cocoon:_Story_of_the_Tamamayu "Jade Cocoon is probably my favorite game of all time. It was a PSX gem that was sadly mostly overlooked as being a knock-off of Pokemon."
[ds]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls "Dark Souls is a game that didn't grab me too well at first for some reason, but one I have grown to love. And before You ask, as of now, I have *not* played any other Souls games."
[adom]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Domains_of_Mystery "ADOM is a roguelike that has been in development for 20 years now. I love playing it, though I admit I am not very good at it, and have never beat it."
[cm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Magic "The Circle of Magic series (along with other of Tamora Pierce's works had such a profound impact on me in so many ways."
[kv]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaavren_Romances "The Phoenix Guards helped me realize exactly how much I liked flowery language and sword and sorcery fiction. "
[vt]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Brust#Vlad_Taltos "Vlad Taltos, as a series, is just so easy to recommend to people. Fantasy, Mystery, Action, Drama... It has it all."
[ll]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Legaia "The Legend of Legaia is one of those games no one ever talks about, but I loved it as a kid. Largely, I think, because of the world it presented."
[at]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_tonelico "Ar Tonelico is just a masterpiece. That is all I can say. I hope to one day build something as well made as it is, as a world."
[iv]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivalice "Ivalice is tricky: It is a world with certain shared traits across many games, but definitely not a world like the others on this list, in that it is not the same continuity between games."
[lm]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legend_of_Mana "This game always drew me in with the art, music, and world it presented... though You put the world together (like IKEA, almost) as You play the game."
[da]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age "Dragon Age is a series that my best friend, Rachel, got me into a few years ago. I am very glad she did, though hesitant about where the story is going."
