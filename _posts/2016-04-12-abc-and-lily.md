Up until this point, I've written most of my music using
[Lilypond][lily]. 

I've switched from using [Frescobaldi][fresco] to just writing it in
[Emacs][emacs] with a [pdf viewer][zathura] open to monitor compiled
progress. I've switched from writing everything in
[concert pitch][concert] to writing to the
[instruments I'm using][transpose]. But that apparently isn't enough
for me, because now I am adding [ABC Notation][abc] back into the mix.

Before I learned how to write in [Lilypond][lily], I learned
[ABC][abc]. It is simpler, more universally supported, and designed
with traditional and early music in mind (The two genres I tend to
play the most)... So it was a fairly easy choice. But, I quickly found
that it was mostly good for teaching and preservation, not for
creating music someone might listen to or for writing scores of any
kind.

That's the main reason I moved to [Lilypond][lily] in the first place:
[ABC][abc] simply couldn't do what I wanted- and in some ways needed-
it to do. For instance, writing out banjo tablature would have been
nearly impossible in ABC. So would composing a 5 minute long, 8
instrument score: [ABC][abc] simply isn't the right tool for that. So,
I abandoned [ABC][abc] and moved to [Lilypond][lilypond] shortly
thereafter, and hadn't looked back until recently.

Now, I think I've found a use for [ABC][abc] in my workflow.

See, when I compose something, I am coming from a mostly
[Traditional Music][trad] background. So, to me, the melody line is of
the utmost importance: That is, the unembellished, straightforward,
basic theme of the piece. Even in pieces like
[Sky Will Forget the Brilliant][compose] and [Nubivagant][compose], it
all started with a melody line and worked out from there. 

But, see, the problem I've been having with that is that most of my
pieces follow the all-too-familiar form of Irish music: **ABAC**, and
then either a second form or repeat. Which, I mean, there is nothing
wrong with that: It works, especially in pieces like
[Calea Victoriei][compose] and [High Resolutions][compose]. But I
don't want to lean on something because it's all I know. I want it to
be a conscious choice.

So, I need to branch out. But, I still like starting with a melody, in
the same way that a baker likes to start with a yeast sponge and an
artist likes to start with preliminary shapes.

In comes [ABC Notation][abc]. Since it is built specifically to target
a melody (and actually has an in-built function for structured repeats
like **ABAC**), it is very easy for me to write a melody out in. And
then, because I am so limited to just the melody line (and
chords/lyrics, if I want), I'm forced to keep it simple and
clean. 

Once the melody has been completed in [ABC][abc], I can then let it
rest and percolate a bit, along with any variations or related themes
I might want to include alongside it... And then, once I have that
idea down, I can compose how a group of instruments might *actually
choose* to embellish, arrange, and play the theme (and write *that*
out in [Lilypond][lily].

It slows my process down by a fair margin, but so far it's produced a
higher-quality finished product, in my opinion. And, when it comes to
my own work, I really do care about the quality, in the end... So, I
think it's a positive switch.

If You compose music, what is *Your* process? Do You start with
chordal structure, melodic theming, or something different? And, on
the off chance You are familiar with either of the software suites
referenced above, what do You think of them? I'd love to hear Your
stories in the comments below.
