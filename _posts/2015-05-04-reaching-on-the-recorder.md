I've recently been trying to extend my range on the
[Recorder][recorder].

Up until this point, I've mostly stayed in the safe, easy lower
octave. [Nine is Fine][nine] after all, right? But that limits the
pieces You can play rather greatly, and the keys in which You can play
them even more so. So, as I am diving deeper into my studies of
[Early Music][early], I feel the need to stretch my wings, so to
speak.

It started when I was practicing the [Bransle des Hermites][hermites]
a while back. The way it is written, it sits squarely in between the
lowest and second lowest octaves on the
[alto recorder][alto recorder]. This means it uses a few notes I have
little to no experience actually playing on the instrument, and I
would have to learn them in order to play it.

{% endraw %}

Luckily, I'd already done the homework (intellectually, at least) for
the [fingerings on the recorder][fingerings], all the way up through
its range... so, with a little more effort, I was able to
[play it][youtube] through a few times (Though not quite well enough
to record for my [soundcloud][soundcloud] yet. Stay tuned!). It was
fun, but a pretty different experience for me, musically.

First of all, the [recorder][recorder] has interesting
[dynamics][dynamics] vs other wind instruments. Higher notes tend to
be a bit louder, especially when You are new to the instrument. And
playing loud is a difficult thing for me to do at home (I'll make
another post on that some other time).

More than that, though, is the fact that I have mostly played
[string instruments][harp] like my harp, the banjo, the bass and the
guitar.

On those kinds of instruments, [fingering][stringfinger] tends to be
very constant on the instrument, no matter the octave. On the
recorder, this is not the case: Not only are there multiple fingerings
for many notes, but there are also different fingerings depending on
which octave You are playing in.

I find myself playing the wrong fingering instinctively, and that
makes the recorder do this very odd [flarbing][flarb] noise. And
maintaining my [breath control][breath], [embouchure][emb], and
[finger height][fingers] take so much of my attention at this point
that a mistake like that stops the tune in its tracks, for me.

Which, of course, is frustrating. But I am used to that kind of
frustration by now, I would say. In a way, I find it comforting: It is
a sign I am [going the right way][vgsign] in my musical practice.

So, much like the [clarinet][clarinet] (which I am saving for when I
have my own room, after the move coming up in a month or two), I have
a *lot* to learn. But, [taking the first step][step] is important, and
I have taken that step towards mastering both main octaves on this
beautiful instrument.


[recorder]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_(musical_instrument) "I have three recorders: A Sopranino, A Soprano, and an Alto. I definitely am more used to playing F based instruments (Sopranino, Alto) Than their C based counterparts (Soprano, Garklein, Tenor)... But it is just a matter of transposing the notes to switch. Otherwise, the fingerings are identical."
[nine]: http://www.susato.com/konakart/Nine-is-Fine/1_337_-1_11.do "Nine is Fine is an interesting series by Susato Press, where they arranged a bunch of pieces for instruments with only a nine note range: That is, the range of a ninth. Which is the range You can get to on a recorder without over-blowing at all, just using the simple, book 1 fingerings."
[early]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/02/11/early-music-studies/ "Early Music is written differently depending on the era that it comes from. Medieval music tends to be mostly single melody lines with no key noted, or more if it was arranged like in Nine is Fine. Renaissance music *can* be the same, but is usually in a defined key at least... and often has multiple parts already written for it."
[hermites]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/04/28/bransle-des-hermites/ "I wrote a post about this piece about a week ago. I'm getting it down, but it is not quite to the level where I'd feel comfortable posting it anywhere. When I do post it, it'll probably just be the melody on a recorder... And maybe a harp backing, I haven't decided yet."
[alto recorder]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alto_recorder "The Alto, or Treble, Recorder is *the* Recorder for solo music, according to a few things I have read. I have one which I did a number on as a young adult, and I am currently considering ordering a new one in plastic from ASW. If/when I do, it will probably become my most played of the bunch: It has a beautiful, full-of-character sound."
[fingerings]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/02/12/recorder-fingering-chart/ "I have used this chart numerous times since I wrote it out. It was a very useful thing to do; So useful that, when I decide to pick up the clarinet again, I will probably do one for that as well. Not having to look up fingerings in a book or a search is a boon, which keeps me playing and not getting distracted."
[youtube]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGZ9WnIAEY0 "This video is what the piece would sound like in a group. It also has a good example of the dance being performed, at what looks like an SCA event."
[soundcloud]: https://soundcloud.com/cdr255 "I post fairly regularly to my soundcloud, but usually one take recordings that are (for the most part) unedited. I use it more as a way to give myself a deadline with composition or practice. When I want to actually publish my music, I will do so through band camp, I think."
[dynamics]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recorder_%28musical_instrument%29#Dynamics "I've read and been told numerous times that, as You go up in register on the recorder, You also go up in pitch. This article says that that is a myth, but only for those who know the instrument really well. I think I'd agree with that, and I am so far away from getting there that it is almost not worth noting at all."
[harp]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2014/12/28/replacing-a-harp-lever/ "String instruments are more of my bread and butter, but I wanted to branch out into a type of instrument I was less comfortable with. I chose wind (and not brass or percussion) because it tends to be quieter (if You want it to be), the fingerings tend to transfer well, and I really, really like the sound of the oboe and the crumhorn."
[stringfinger]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo "When You learn a chord on the guitar or banjo or harp, and You want to move it up an octave, You simply move it up an octave (twelve frets or 8 strings(. But when You do the same on the recorder, You not only need to over blow but You also need to change the fingering of the note somewhat."
[flarb]: http://www.reddit.com/r/LearnUselessTalents/comments/34aue0/learn_how_to_flarb_sort_of_like_whistling_but/ "Yes, I am very aware of the urban dictionary post that is referenced in this document. I think that that only stands to make it funnier than it already sounds. Flarbing is a funny thing to say, and much more interesting to read about than multitonics."
[breath]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocal_pedagogy "Breath control is what long tones are for: Being able to make a note on a wind instrument sound the same each and every time that You play it, and making that note sound good. Then, when You get good, being able to change the note's sound for dynamic reasons, deliberately. I am still working on the first part, of course."
[emb]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embouchure "Embouchure is definitely the hardest part for me to get down. I simply try *way* too hard when it comes to things like it, and then I burn my muscles out and the embouchure fails. Add tonguing, breathing, and fingering to that and You are very distracted as a beginner on a wind instrument."
[fingers]:  http://forum.saxontheweb.net/archive/index.php/t-88969.html "I teach guitar and banjo, and in doing so have learned to exaggerate my finger movements to a point. Then, I also play the bass, where the strings are huge and, as a performance thing, I might exaggerate or showboat a bit. So, when I learned that You need to keep Your fingers as close in as possible while playing a wind instrument, I knew it was not going to be easy."
[vgsign]: https://twitter.com/thequinnspiracy/status/505220006007689218 "If You are wondering around and You come to a huge group of enemies in a video game, that means that You are headed towards the boss. Or at least the end of the level."
[clarinet]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarinet "I like the sound of the Clarinet, and even took lessons about a year ago. When we are settled after the move, I may start again... Though it uses a different embouchure than the recorder does."
[step]: https://xkcd.com/505/ "I tend to focus too much on the long term, and then use my perfectionist personality to work so hard in such a short period of time that I burn out and give up. I've been working on that this year (pacing myself) and I think I am getting better at avoiding the point where I hate doing what I am doing, and want to do *anything* else."
