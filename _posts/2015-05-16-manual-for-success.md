Last night, I was exhausted.

For the last three nights, I haven't [slept][sleep] very well. I get
into these modes, when I am being creative, where my
[sleep schedule][slsched] (or lack thereof) becomes even more chaotic
than usual. I start going to bed only when I am very tired, and waking
up a scant couple of hours later. It's pretty unhealthy, now that I
think about it.

But last night, my brother was over.  After playing
[Aquapazza][aquapazza] for a while, he wanted to play
[Ni no Kuni][ninokuni], a game he'd just bought. Because I am so
interested in [Con-scripts][conscripts], he'd mentioned that there was
one for this game (Called [Nazca√§n Script][script]), and it was
outlined in the manual (which it was).

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

This got me to flip through the rest of the [manual][manual]. It was
fairly standard fair for a modern video game manual: black and white
pages, no pictures, very short content repeated in multiple languages,
no frills. This, then, made me want to look at an older
[manual][manual] (back from the [90s][nineties] when gaming had just
hit the mainstream) to see just exactly how much had changed.

My copy of [Jade Cocoon][jade] just happened to be right on the
end table, so it was the one I chose. It was a good one to contrast
with [Ni no Kuni][ninokuni]: Both were generally colorful games, both
had art from [Studio Ghibli][ghibli] ([Katsuya Kondo][kondo] for
[Jade Cocoon][jade], [Toshihiro Kuriaki][kuriaki] and the rest of
[Ghibli][ghibli] for [Ni no Kuni][ninokuni]) at their core, and both
were released for [Sony][sony] consoles. So, there are a lot of
similarities.

But, let's focus on the differences I found in the older manual, for
[Jade Cocoon][jade].

First of all, it was thicker... Possibly because it was stouter
([PSX][psx] games came in square boxes, not [DVD][dvd] style
ones). Second, not only were the front and back in color, but the
__entire thing__ was in full color, with unique designs added to the
borders of the pages to fit in with the style of the game. There was a
spread for controlling the game, but also [glossary][glossary],
[story][story], and [concept art][concept] sections... all with images
and quotes from the game.

It explained things that weren't explained in the game (Something
[Ni no Kuni][ninokuni] admittedly didn't need... because the tutorial
was unskippable, mandatory, and __LONG__). It talked at length about
the different families of [monsters][monsters] in the game, with
sketches (__not__ screencaps) of the monsters that it highlighted. And
finally, it delineated mechanics in a helpful way: Here's how You
increase Your health, here's how You merge Your monsters, here's a bit
of lore about a secret minion hidden deep in the game.

My point in talking about this, I guess, can be summed up with a
single sentence: _There was a time when the [manual][manual] that came
with a game could be a part of the [experience][xp] You had with the
game._

I understand __why__ it changed: These older manuals were probably
much more expensive to produce, and definitely took a lot more time to
develop than the new ones. But it's just a shame that it changed so
universally.

If and when I release a game, I want to make the older style of
manual... not the newer one.


[sleep]: https://xkcd.com/776/ "My lack of sleep on a regular basis is one of my two main vices. The other one being over eating, which I tend to do more often than I would like. I have a particularly bad mountain dew habit, and I tend not to buy chips because I eat them all too quickly. These two kind of feed into each other, too: If I don't sleep, I want to eat more, and if I eat too much, I don't want to sleep."
[slsched]: http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/ "This link outlines many common sleep schedules in terms of duration, with a slant towards polyphasic sleeping as opposed to monophasic. In this article, I was mostly talking about *when* I sleep, but it is also good to point out that I do not sleep the same amount each night, by any stretch... nor do I sleep in the same cycle, as defined in this article."
[aquapazza]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquapazza:_Aquaplus_Dream_Match "Aquaplus is a technical fighting game with characters from various Leaf-developed visual novels, published by Aquaplus and Atlus, in America. I play a lot of Visual Novels, and Leaf has always been one of my favorite companies (for the few games by them I could actually play)."
[ninokuni]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ni_no_Kuni#Development "Ni no Kuni looked, by what I saw last night while having this freak out about a 20 year old manual, to be a fun little modern jRPG, with all of the good AND bad things that come along with that. Very railroady, very verbose in tutorial, and very focused on cut scenes... but with a very good atmosphere, interestingly deep combat system, and well built world."
[conscripts]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/05/01/scripting-a-language/ "I've written only a few times about my love of Constructed Scripts. I have three which are at the point where I can write in them right now: Valleyscript, Vinescript, and Wirescript. I like creating them, which I've talked about before... but I also like learning them, which I have never discussed! Maybe a future blog post?"
[script]: http://ninokuni.wikia.com/wiki/Nazca%C3%A4n_Script "This is the script from Ni no Kuni. It looks pretty, but isn't anything too too special: No odd rules, no differences in the language. Just new glyphs in a different style. I wonder why they chose these glyphs specifically?"
[manual]: http://kotaku.com/nintendo-is-slowly-reinventing-the-video-game-instructi-1515814941 "I am 100% against the idea of digital manuals as Nintendo is moving towards with the WiiU and 3DS. I used to collect, specifically, video game manuals... and these little glorified PDFs that are becoming standard are not the same thing at all. I hope the day does not come where I need to buy the collector's edition to get a paper manual..."
[nineties]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990s_in_video_gaming "The 1990s were, after all, where I got started with gaming. I remember first renting an N64 from Blockbuster, and playing the first game we got for the Playstation (It was Spyro the Dragon). I also remember a time before that, where we had just the Sega Genesis and MS-DOS. It was a completely different world, from now."
[jade]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Cocoon:_Story_of_the_Tamamayu "My favorite video game of all time, Jade Cocoon embodies a lot of what I think an RPG (and specifically, a Monster Breeder) should be, from its atmosphere to its characters to its enemies to its game play... all the way to its manual, which started this whole post."
[ghibli]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studio_Ghibli "Studio Ghibli... With Hayao Miyazaki gone the way of Keiji Inafune (and Hideo Kojima, soon) I am sure we are due to see a bunch of changes at Studio Ghibli. Which is sad, because just about every part of my life I can remember a Miyazaki-Ghibli Movie playing in the background, from Totoro to Kiki to Howl to Arrietty."
[kondo]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuya_Kond%C5%8D "Katsuya Kondo not only did the character design for Jade Cocoon, he also did it for my favorite Studio Ghibli movie, Kiki's Flying Delivery Service. I love everything that he touches, and though I don't put enough effort into graphic arts to really consider myself an artist in that regard, he is one of my idols."
[kuriaki]: http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,561818/ "Toshihiro Kuriaki is unfortunately very hard to find information about online. I wanted to get this post out today, so I couldn't spend a lot of time looking... So here is the mobygames page for Kuriaki, since it will be updated as more information (and more work!) comes out."
[sony]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Sony_consoles "Sony Consoles have been a big part of my life since I was around 7 or 8, though I will admit I did not purchase a PS3 (yet)."
[psx]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_(console) "The Sony Playstation, like many of the best things in life, was created out of spite: A deal went bad with Nintendo halfway through development, and they released the unfinished project as its own console. Of all of the non-handheld consoles I have played in my life, the Playstation made the biggest impact."
[dvd]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD "DVDs have mostly gone the way of the dinosaur, but it is worth noting that the modern game case came about by all three major game companies (Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft) of the Sixth Generation of Video Gaming aping the standard DVD case. "
[glossary]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary "I love Glossaries, in manuals and books. It's like the codex in Bioware games, or Item Descriptions in Souls like games... It tells You just enough about what You are talking about, without going overboard before You are ready."
[story]: http://www.lingualgamers.com/thesis/story_video_games.html "John Carmack, one of the developers for DOOM, once famously said that the 'story in a game is like a story in a porn movie: It's expected to be there, but it's not very important.' I used to vehemently disagree, but I think that right now, Gaming is almost TOO focused on telling a story (in the literal sense of doing so) and not nearly focused enough on being a good game... so, now I agree."
[concept]: http://www.creativeuncut.com/game-art-galleries.html "Video Game Concept Art is a special thing to me. Seeing the pure, unchanged vision someone had for something as polished as a video game is very interesting, almost like peeking behind the stage at a play."
[monsters]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2013/09/20/Monster-Breeder-First-Post/ "Monster Breeders have largely faded from popularity, with the exception of Pokemon. It's a shame, but probably for the best... for that genre to come back, there would need to be some big innovations... otherwise, it would just be aping Pokemon or one of the other big ones."
[xp]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay "Most people think that games live and die by their game play. I think that game play is very important, but not nearly so much so as the entirety of the piece: Music, Art, Game Play, Story, and Presentation."
