 'This is the front of the Box Art for Jade Cocoon. I chose this game
 when it was still new in stores at a Toys R Us when I was very young.
 I remember it being a crossroads-style desicion for me, too. Most
 things were back then, I have always had a bit of an overthinking
 problem when it comes to decisions, especially trivial ones. The game
 I did not choose was a game called Dragon Seeds, an even lesser known
 game which I will eventually talk about on here, as it was another
 monster breeding game. It all worked out, though, because this game
 is still my favorite video game of all time.')

**tl;dr** - I introduce Jade Cocoon, my favorite video game of all
  time, noting its theme, its monster style, its raising style, and a
  few other odds and ends.
  
### Introduction ###
Jade Cocoon. I will not lie here, this is pretty much my favorite
video game. If You have ever seen [Sequelitis][sequelitis] by Egoraptor, I am at
least as obsessed with this game as he is with Megaman X. So, I guess
my point here is, I will attempt to be unbiased, but expect a little
bit of gushing here and there.

__Jade Cocoon: Story of the Tamamayu__ is a Playstation (that is,
Playstation 1) game published in 1998 by [Genki][genki] in Japan, and
brought to the US by [Crave Entertainment][crave]. The music was
composed by [Kimitaka Matsumae][kimitaka] and might I add, it is
exquisite. Though it has not been reprinted in the US since 1999,
it is on the PlayStation Network for download -- in Japan.

Before You ask, a "Tamamayu" *is* a "Jade Egg," or in this context, a
"Jade Cocoon." The original Japanese name for this game is 玉繭物語:
*Tamamayu Monogatari*, or literally, *"The Story of the Jade Cocoon."*

The gist of the game is this: You are the only son of an AWOL __Cocoon
Master__, and are still coming of age when the Locusts of the
Apocalypse, the *Onibubu*, descend upon Your village. They leave it
only when half of the village has fallen into "a sleep from which they
cannot wake." It is decided then that You must become the Cocoon
Master immediately, and go into the forest to seek a cure for the
sleeping sickness and to save Your village.

![Jade Cocoon PAL Box Art, Front](http://i.imgur.com/6cIS051.jpg
'And *this* is the box art for the PAL version of the game. Now, I am
not entirely obsessed with first impressions and looking cool. No,
really I believe that the true measure of a game goes far beyond the
box art. But come on, how did we get monsters-in-bubbleland when
Europe got this? This is soooo much cooler of a game cover than the
North American one, I do not understand how we didn't use it. It would
definitely have increased sales, at least a little bit.')

It is a brilliant set up, which really sets the tone for the rest of
the game: You simply must continue searching the forests and growing
stronger, because otherwise everyone You have ever known will die from
the sleeping sickness, their souls trapped in the Dreamworld
forevermore. It blew my mind when I first played it, and is still a
much more grabbing impetus than many other games have.

### Theme of Jade Cocoon ###
Allow me to take a few moments to analyse some themes that this game
puts forth. First, let me quote the opening of the game, before You
even decide to Start or Continue:


    "Ehlrim, God of the Forest, Source of all life.
	He released his servants, the Divine Spirits, unto the lands.
	
	He spoke:
	'I am that which has given You life.'
	For a time, they brought life and happiness to the Forest.
	
	But soon the forest was visited by fate.
	
	The Divine Spirits created a beast in their own image.
	Ehlrim warned:
	'That is the Beast of Knowledge, and it will Someday bring
	temptation upon You.'
	'Thou Shalt not associate with it.'
	
	The Divine Spirits so promised, and gave birth to the beast of
	their own image. Such was Man's Beginning.
	
	Time Passed, and the Forest was again visited by Fate.
	A Divine Spirit was seduced by a Beast of Knowledge. And so the
	promise to Ehlrim was broken.
	
	The Spirit Lost its Divine Power, and by the Child of Man and
	Spirit, it was gained. This new power Threatened Ehlrim, and so
	was divided into Light, and Darkness."


![An example of the Forest's Beautiful Scenery](http://i.imgur.com/ihRiTIf.jpg
'This is an example of the forest in the game. There are so many
prerendered backgrounds, and they are all so beautiful, that this game
truly becomes a submersive and realistic environment. I was always
struck by the beauty of these forests, and the inherent mystery that
lied within. I would walk by an item multiple times before noticing it
and finally picking it up. And this was on the ps1, too. Such a
beautiful game.')

__Wow.__ Not many games use a _Creation Myth_ as their opening
movie. This always struck me as making the world in which this game
takes place (which is a ficticious world when Man is being besieged by
the aforemention 'Child of Man and Spirit.' This is a game, for
entertainment, please do not take it personally if You have strong
religious beliefs.) so much more real. I can count the number of games
I have played that go this far with their backstory on my fingers, and
that sticks out to me.

Anyway, aside from the stories of Ehlrim and the Divine Spirits, we
have two cultures in the town: the Villagers, and the Nagi. The Nagi
are travelling Spiritualists who can perform the Purification Magic
necessary for the Cocoon Master to tame Divine Beasts. This is another
point which sticks out: Your wife is a member of the Nagi Tribe, and
is __Absolutely Crucial__ to Your abilities as a Cocoon Master.

In most of the games I have played, if Romance is even hinted at, You
leave those people behind in order to save the world or become the
strongest or whatever. In this game, without Your wife, You would be
absolutely nothing. And You do *not* start the game married, so it is
not just a cool little fluff piece.

![Mahbu, from Jade Cocoon](http://i.imgur.com/xTXmJbd.jpg
'I wanted to get an in-game screenshot, but Haven't got the hardware
to do that yet. She has some very poignant dialogue, and I would have
liked to include it, but all of the screens I could find on Google
Image Search were not up to the quality I try to maintain. Anyway,
Here is a small portrait of her. I wish that more games included
romance in this way, where You literally support one another in Your
daily lives. Such good writing.')

__NOTE:__ I am  not saying that marriage is  something everyone should
do or even  that there is someone for everyone out  there. I am simply
saying it is nice to see  the role of Your character's partner be more
than just a walk on cameo or  a dead body, which are both so much more
common in games.

__ALSO NOTE:__ I am not advocating a "Women stay home while Men
Adventure" trend, either. I would be overjoyed to see a game which
reversed these roles, or had same-sex relationships or anything else
where two people, in a romantic relationship, are able to help one
another through the game.

Anyway, I am just rambling at this point, so I will continue onto the
Monsters. Perhaps I will talk more about the themes here in future
installments.


### The Monsters ### 
This is the reason You are reading, right? The Monsters (also called
minions) in this game are given the name, "__Divine Beasts__," because
of the story told above. Your job, as a cocoon master, is to purify
Divine Beasts with the help of Your Wife, Mahbu. 

There are 150 Minions in this game, and they can be merged together to
create many more hybrids. This is the coolest part of the monster
system, mechanically speaking: You don't merge a flying type and a
fire type to get a flying fire type, You merge a Skaeeb and a Patash
and get something in between depending upon the order Your merge them
in.

![Arpatron x Pataimel Merger](http://i.imgur.com/Ds41iPt.jpg
'This is an example. This merger was created using an Arpatron
[a blue dragon] and a Pataimel [a red wasp]. There is a load of
gradation here, and a lot more so in the form of the monster than in
just about any other game I have played. Simple math means that, even
if we only consider first merged monsters, there are 11175 different
combinations You can make. And then, You can take that 1 out of 11175
and make a different monster by merging it again. Amazing.')

And You are __definitely__ encouraged to merge as much as
possible. That is the main way Your Beasts level up: by Merging them
together. The only other way to raise them to be stronger is to kill a
bunch of wild minions... but then, Your _Character's_ level never goes
up, and it will be harder and harder to capture new minions.

Koris said it best: "Killing will get You nowhere." Your job as a
Cocoon Master is to soothe troubled spirits, not kill them. Which in
itself is a very different take on the entire "Monster Breeder"
Concept. I mean, what other game has it built into the very mechanics
that killing a wild monster is a bad idea?

Anyway, as a final little note, there are two different
strength/weakness circles built into the monsters in this game:
Elements and Abilities.

First, Elements: "Earth Repels Water, Water Extinguishes Fire, Fire
Eliminates Air, and Air Whittles Away Earth." Standard Hyle here, but
this little saying is how I learned it as a child.

And Finally, Abilities: There is a chart each Divine Beast You capture
has. It is a grid on which there is a dot. At the Top, We have
Attack. At the Bottom, we have Magic. To the Right, Speed. To the
Left, Defense. The better You are at one of these two pairs (Attacking
and Speed, let's say) the worse You are at the others (in this case,
Magic and Defense).

### Ending Notes ###

![Jade Cocoon OST Cover](http://i.imgur.com/38eEeBD.jpg 
'I have left a lot of stuff out of this little expose. I barely
touched on the music, the story, the characters or really even many
of the monsters. But I wanted to keep this to a managable size, not
book length, and I also wanted to keep some back to talk about in the
future. This was a simple introduction, and nothing more. However, if
You want to hear some great music, check this sound track out. It is a
masterpiece from the PS1 era.')

Anyway, I don't want to get too in depth here, I just wanted to give a
little introduction. This is indeed one of the most overlooked games
of the genre, and unfortunately has never really gotten a fair review
without being compared to its more successful bretheren. I have
attempted to do something of the sort here, and hope I have enticed
You to give it a try one day. I promise that You will not regret it.
