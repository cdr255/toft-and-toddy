I've recently gotten a lot more strict about writing, especially
fiction.

Part of that is a [Story Code][Story Code] I've developed (and I'm
still developing, in that philosophical, mental gymnastics way) for
Prose and Prosody. I got the idea, funnily enough, from
[Capes][Capes RPG]- and its mention of the "Comics Code" that was
common in the [Silver Age][Silver Age] of
[American Comics][American Comics]. It is basically a set of
boundaries and rules for writing stories which agree with me and my
brand of fiction.

<!-- more -->

Following it has, thus far, helped me to [stay true][Kedishire] to
some messages I want my work to convey. As an added benefit, it has
gotten me past some of the more abstract parts of
[pre-writing][Snowflake] without too much thought: I've already
decided on this or that, thanks to the [Code][Story Code], and instead
I just need to define it in the context of this specific story. But, I
have *not* [committed to it 100%][Least I Could Do] (at least for the
second, softer, half). Doing so would stunt my ability to push
boundaries, which is something [I like to do][Questionable Content] on
occasion.

Anyway, I thought I would elucidate a few of the points from the
[Code][Story Code] in greater detail here.

1. __Beauty is Mundane. / Real Life is Magical.__

   Growing up, I read a lot of [fantasy / science fiction][scififant]
   books. Some of my favorites were by [Tamora Pierce][Tamora Pierce],
   others were by [Diane Duane][Diane Duane]... But my favorites
   always seemed to have a few things in common.

   One of those was this point, which has only become more important to
   me as I have grown older. (The others I will talk about in another
   essay).

   Anyone can say that
   [Prince Charming was handsome][Prince Charming]. Anyone can assume
   that [Gandalf][gandalf] is not a
   [conjurer of cheap tricks][conjurer]. Anyone can see that a learned
   wizard can do a lot of good (or bad) in the world. And anyone can
   see imperfections in anyone else.

   But what their books showed me was amazing: A world where magic can
   be worked by [learning a language][The Speech],
   [spinning some thread][Sandry], [asking nicely][The Speech], or
   [cooking a meal][Gorse]. A world where people are different from
   one another: Shorter, taller, fatter, thinner, male, female, young,
   old. People of different [ethnicities][Briar], from
   [all over][Nita] the place, have different [cultures][Daja], skin
   colors, and personalities- not because they are different races,
   but because they are different *people*.

   And people have *imperfections*: [Moles][moles], skin tags,
   freckles, dimples, freckles, [mottling][mottling], stretchmarks,
   scars, ticks, habits, [accents][accents], prejudices, issues,
   histories, affectations... These are the very things that
   [make us human][humanity], and they can be shown in a character
   *without* compromising their worth.

   That is something I want to show in my work, too.
   
2. __Everyone can be Anything.__
   
   Does anyone else remember the movie [Ratatouille][Ratatouille]?
   
   It's memorable to me for a few reasons (A big one being it was the
   first movie I snuck into during a date, story for
   [another time][Another Day]) but the important one here is the
   [moral][moral] presented at the climax of the story:

   > "Not everyone can become a great artist; But a great artist
   > can come from anywhere". - Anton Ego, Ratatouille (2007)
   
   This is basically the reasoning behind this part of my
   [Code][Story Code].

   A lot of stories are cast with deliberate [tropes][tropes] assigned
   to their characters: The [Damsel in Distress][damsel], the
   [Quirky and Manic Girl][manic], the [Tsundere][tsundere]. I
   respect those [tropes][tropes] for what they are, but I do find the
   idea that they are mostly constants in the storytelling
   world to be tiresome at best.

   A good book that defies common [tropes][tropes] rather obliquely
   (and that I am currently reading) is "[Fire Logic][Fire Logic]" by
   [Laurie J Marks][Laurie Marks]. I'll talk more about that in
   another post, but I wanted to recommend it here anyway, since a lot
   of my reasoning right now will come from my
   [reading that book][Goodreads].
   
   You being a boy doesn't mean [You like sports][We Like Sports] or
   [beer][beer xkcd] or [violence][sax and violins]. You being a girl
   doesn't mean You like [crafts][knitting] or [clothes][shoes] or
   [wine][alcohol]. You being young doesn't mean You want acceptance
   or thrills or handouts. You being old doesn't mean You are wise or
   polite or out of touch. You living on a [space station][BAUD]
   doesn't mean You have any interest in space any more than someone
   living on Earth has in interest in the Earth.

   And a man and a woman are working together on something or hanging
   out doesn't mean they are going to fall in love, have sex, or
   otherwise
   [deepen some aspect of their relationship][Movie Romance]. (This
   one gets on my nerves a *lot*).

   I actually have noticed I build my [Pathfinder][pf] characters with
   this whole idea in mind, too (Kind of
   [anti-power-gaming][power gaming]). I had a Fighter who was geared
   towards disabling, a Witch who was built on Constitution, a Bard
   who didn't use spells or his sword nearly as much as his Feats,
   Items and Tricks... A lot of my concepts were defied
   [tropey][tropes] ideas about what a character should do or be able
   to do in a situation.

   Of course, some of my best concepts didn't, too... Which is why
   this is a [Soft Rule][moderation].

3. __Every Aspect of Life is Beautiful, but Don't Stop and Stare.__
   
   This is perhaps the one I feel I've represented the worst on
   [that page][Story Code], and the one which made me want to do this
   in the first place.
   
   That said, even talking about it now is difficult for me... Which I
   attribute to the overarching issue of
   [repression in modern media][repression]. More on that in another
   post. But, I [digress][digressing].

   People change clothes. [Sleep naked][Lit]. Take baths. Use
   toilets. Some have breasts, others don't. Most
   [have nipples][nipples]. People have sex. Fight. Bump into each
   other. Hit each other. Many people menstruate regularly. Some get
   pregnant. Some give birth. Some wish they could but can't. Some
   wish they couldn't but can.

   Some people are plump. Skinny. Muscular. Rail-thin. Some have
   bigger butts, chests, penises, bellies, noses, ears, chins. Some
   have smaller ones. Some have smooth skin. Loose skin. Rough
   skin. Some are hairy, some are not.

   In other words, people are people. And those moments of
   [humanity][humanity] represented above: Being nude, using the
   bathroom, having sex, rough housing, seeing ourselves in passing
   glimpses where the mask of 'decency' falls for but a
   moment... Those are real. Part of the experience.

   And I do not feel like they should be absent from a fictional
   character's life.

   That said, focusing too much on one of these things, especially
   **for no other reason than the fact that it is happening**, is not
   something that should be in my work. There is a difference between
   acknowledging and including the real and human parts of life and
   dwelling on them. Obsessing about any single part of something is
   (at best) boring or (at worst) vulgar and obscene.

   In short: I don't want to clean up my characters. They are real (if
   exceptional) [fictional people][fairly odd], who live real
   [fictional lives][fairly odd]. And removing those parts of their
   lives that might upset some people because of their existence is
   not something I am willing to do.

The [Story Code][Story Code] is still very much a work in progress,
and is subject to change at my own whim and fancy. It exists, not only
to help me in writing, but as a quick set of agreements my readers
should understand about my work. I hope I have defined them a bit
clearer here. What do You think?



[Story Code]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/p/story-code-story-code-story-code-you.html "Having an in-house story code is actually something that has been very helpful to me over the last few months. It serves as a reminder to my ideals, my goals, and the promises I've made to myself. I highly recommend anyone involved in a creative pursuit give it a try."
[Capes RPG]: http://www.museoffire.com/Games/about.html "I've mentioned it before a bunch, but Capes RPG is a very fun, fairly fluffy game. We are in the final prep stages of running a Steven Universe AU based game using the system; I'll be sure to post about it when it actually comes together."
[Silver Age]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Age_of_Comic_Books "I have a passing familiarity with American Comics, and definitely prefer Marvel over DC. But as for getting *into* comics, I have found it very difficult to do so. I don't really want to buy omnibuses, and I don't really like jumping into a story in the middle, which makes things very difficult. More in another post."
[American Comics]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_comic_book "I actually think the Comics Code Authority was way too strict when it came to most things. But, the way that the *idea* of a code was presented in Capes makes much more sense to me, and the code I have set up actually bears little resemblance to the Comics Code presented in the 1950's."
[Kedishire]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/2015/08/ked-02-ysvelten-dezbana.html "The link here is really just because of the first words, but it is a theme I will represent throughout the series as a whole. Being true to Yourself is a very difficult yet important lesson I have been trying to master for the last 15 years or so, and I have a lot of work left ahead of me. But in regards to my work, I think the Code helps a lot."
[Snowflake]: http://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/ "I use my own variation on the Snowflake method to flesh out the basics of a story before really beginning my prep work. That said, having set ideas (like those presented below) that I am not willing to compromise on really helps develop those little drops of water into beautiful snowflakes."
[Least I Could Do]: # "If anything, I think that people would say I am a bit too gung ho when committing to something. I am a very jump-in-the-deep-end kind of person with most things. But I am learning to temper my enthusiasm a bit when it comes to high-level concepts, especially in my working life, because it tends to lead me to burn out."
[Questionable Content]: http://www.questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=2699 "Pushing boundaries is probably my biggest social vice. I think it stems from my intense curiosity about life and the world around me. I very rarely leave well enough alone, if only because doing so is only well enough. I want to do better than that. "
[scififant]: https://www.sfsite.com/columns/amy26.htm "Fantasy and Science Fiction are wonderful genres of literature, because they can present things, ideas, concepts, emotions and such in ways that more realistic genres couldn't. They also allow me to disengage more from the world around me, and that helps me to relax more than I otherwise would be able to."
[Tamora Pierce]: http://www.tamora-pierce.com/ "Tamora Pierce. If there is one author that I have to give accolades to for making me the man I am today, I would have to give them to her. I read so many series by her growing up: The Circle of Magic, the Circle Opens, the Lioness Quartet, The Immortals Quartet.... They introduced me to so many concepts I hold very dear to my heart, and I haven't the space to describe the impact they've had on every aspect of my life. If You are reading this: Thank You so much, Tamora."
[Diane Duane]: http://www.dianeduane.com/ "Diane Duane was the other side of Fantasy for me growing up. To counter the wildly fantastic worlds of Emelan and Tortall, this world was an overlay on modern New York (a place I frequented as a child and live nearby as an adult). It showed a hidden, magical side to the universe which was available to those worthy and those who sought out the knowledge. I would not be a complete person without her books and Tamora's (and many others, but I feel those and Card's Enders series are paramount), and I must thank her as well. They are definitely both my idols."
[Prince Charming]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Charming "How boring a trope is Prince Charming? Royalty, Wealthy, Beauty, Grace, Strength... He is the Superman of Fairytale land. He has no flaws."
[Gandalf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandalf "Many more people know about Gandalf and Middle Earth than when I was growing up, thanks to the movies. I will say that I liked the Gandalf in my head much better."
[conjurer]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKaw5SjeHx0 "One of his most famous quotes, anyway. Fly, You fools!"
[The Speech]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speech "This was always such an enrapturing part of Diane Duane's books (and Truespeech in general fantasy): The idea that the world around You has a language You can learn, and by learning it You gain knowledge and power to do things You couldn't do before resonates with me quite heavily. More on this in another post."
[Sandry]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandrilene_fa_Toren "Sandry, from the Circle of Magic, largely inspired me to pressure my grandmother to teach me to sew and crochet. This, in turn, taught me that I could make things, and those things would be pretty decent so long as I stuck with it. There is nothing like the thrill of willing something into existence."
[Gorse]: http://tamorapierce.wikia.com/wiki/Gorse "Gorse, who had magic with cooking and food, is a character I attribute my wide interest in cooking to. He effected me much more subtly than most others, but he definitely effected me. I love cooking for people, and seeing them made happy and satisfied by my work."
[Briar]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briar_Moss "The Circle of Magic had many diverse characters in it, from all over the Emelan area. Briar had almond shaped eyes and dark-tan skin, compared to Tris's pale skin and Sandry's sun tanned fair skin. Daja I'll talk about below."
[Nita]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Wizards#Nita "Juanita is one of the duo from the Young Wizards series by Diane Duane. (The other was *actually named* Christopher Rodriguez, which always blew my mind as a kid!). I remember their culture because it was the first time I saw normal, American kids with Spanish / Hispanic backgrounds as main characters in media (As opposed to tokens, or cultural caricatures). Nita was also half Irish, which I have roots in as well. That resonated with me a lot, because they shared those cultural traits You inherit from different backgrounds (like family members speaking Spanish) that most other characters didn't have. "
[Daja]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daja_Kisubo "Daja had dark brown skin. She was the first character I can remember in books I'd read that had dark brown skin, and I didn't really think anything about that until recently: It honestly had never occurred to me how some people might not have had a character in their stories growing up with darker skin. And that made me sad, for obvious reasons. It is really sucky that mainstream books so rarely include a diverse cast."
[moles]: https://www.aad.org/dermatology-a-to-z/diseases-and-treatments/m---p/moles "I actually have a fair number of moles on my body: The flat, smaller kind. However, I cannot remember a single non-beauty-mark example of a character intentionally having moles in any media where it wasn't an ugly joke."
[mottling]: http://www.wisegeekhealth.com/what-is-mottled-skin.htm "Mottling is something I didn't know the name of until recently, though I knew some people with it growing up. Follow the link to learn more, but I certainly didn't read that in a description anywhere growing up!"
[accents]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent "Accents are difficult to represent in written texts: You can transcribe an accent, but then it becomes difficult for the reader to work out what they are saying. You can say they have an accent, but You risk that being glossed over and forgotten. It is a sticky wicket."
[Ratatouille]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_(film) "I actually enjoyed this movie, though I wonder if that had more to do with my circumstances with seeing it than the actual story. The speech the critic gives at the end is beautiful, though!"
[Another Day]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8nucnkZk-4 "I don't generally kiss and tell, especially not in a public forum. So, You know, don't hold Your breath!"
[moral]: http://www.helpingwritersbecomeauthors.com/storys-theme-2/ "It's fairly important to have a message You are trying to convey in a story. Whether or not that is an actual moral is pretty loosely defined, but that's the word we use for the concept these days."
[damsel]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damsel_in_distress "This is one of many different marginalizing stereotypical character models usually attributed to female characters. I for one am pretty bored with it, but furthermore it has been recognized as a trope for so long that I am bored with the subverted versions of this trope too! Let's just stop with the ultimately helpless characters for a while, guys."
[manic]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ManicPixieDreamGirl "Din Lunahedi was the closest I ever came to recreating this stereotype. She was no-nonsense, did not respect You until You earned it, concerned with her work more than anything else, slightly sociopathic, dismissive of stupidity, nonconforming to gender, sexuality, and racial stereotypes, and one of my top self-made characters. She was AWESOME."
[tsundere]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundere "To depart from the area I'm talking about throughout the rest of this article: Over-dependence on tropes is one of the things currently KILLING the anime industry in my eyes. Formulae are great, but let's let some originality show through now and then, okay guys?"
[Fire Logic]: http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Logic-Elemental-Laurie-Marks/dp/081256653X "Fire Logic is a pretty interesting and engaging story of a nation at war and the people involved both on and off the field. The characters are very well put together, which is important to me in a book. I'm enjoying it a lot."
[Laurie Marks]: http://lauriejmarks.com/ "I am very happy to have stumbled upon Laurie J Marks while looking for some interesting fantasy books to read in this most recent attempt at convincing myself to read more. I love her writing style. Highly recommended, from what I can see in Fire Logic."
[Goodreads]: http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23835045-christopher-rodriguez "I do update my Goodreads account as I read books, and I plan to start reading more soon. Feel free to friend me, I usually friend back."
[We Like Sports]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEVdca9U9LM "What happened to the Lonely Island? I haven't heard about them in a while, so I suppose they have been called to other things."
[beer xkcd]: https://xkcd.com/1534/ "I don't actually drink alcohol, but my favorite tisane (Tension Tamer by Celestial Seasonings) actually has hops in it, so I guess i enjoy their taste at least"
[sax and violins]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ooKasAGXUg "I love this pun for sex and violence. It seems so weird that this has been so present in our consciousness for the last half-century."
[knitting]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet "I love crochetting, and consider myself pretty crafty in other areas, too. I love making things, and making things work."
[shoes]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCF3ywukQYA "Anyone else remember this video? It reminds me of high school, which is (for me) when I first saw it."
[alcohol]: http://ailorian.tumblr.com/post/128001627968 "I don't actually drink any kind of alcohol, but I know from various comics online that it's considered more feminine to like mixed drinks. As for non-alcoholic drinks, I enjoy mixed drinks a lot, though!"
[BAUD]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/2015/04/baud-01-alone-in-detainment.html "This trope is one that I attack pretty heavily in my work. In life, many people fall into things as dilettantes at best, and never leave because doing so would be more difficult than staying where You are. I know many people like this, and so I have a lot of characters like that. This link goes to one."
[Movie Romance]: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/ "As a male introvert who tends to get along better with female people, I find this an extremely annoying stereotype both on and off screen. No, hanging out one-on-one with a woman is not indicative of romantic or sexual interest on either side (or at least, it shouldn't be) and I find it pretty offensive that people can't get that through their heads. It shows a lack of respect for both men and women as human beings, and at times a lack of trust in one person or another. More on this in another post."
[pf]: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ "I use Pathfinder as an example here because I am normally the DM for my normal gaming group. I have to play the role of the Dungeon Master in that group, so I don't get to make characters (to the fullest extent, anyway) as often as I'd like. One of the groups I used to play in was largely a Pathfinder group, and so I got the chance to focus on character creation for a while."
[power gaming]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powergaming "Power gaming, Munchkining, MLG Strats, etc. Are all things that turn me off from many modern games, modern video games as a whole, and many other gamers as well. Optimizing routes or strategies to the degree where a computer could do it is basically giving a computer a handjob: It would prolly be over quicker if You'd just let it do it itself."
[tropes]: http://tvtropes.org/ "Don't misunderstand me: Tropes are very useful tools for memorization, understanding, and *consuming*. As for writing, creating, and *producing*, however, I feel like they are a pretty big crutch people use far too often nowadays, and it would be better to use them as warning signs that something has been done too many times before."
[moderation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moderation "Blind, dogmatic devotion to any one idea or ideal (including this one) is bound to end in problems. Moderation is as key to success in the modern world as it was to all that has come before it."
[repression]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_repression "Repression is something that I feel is misunderstood on both sides: Some feel like the world is a hedonistic hellhole now, some feel like the world is too politically correct and self conscious. In reality, I find people to have a lot of intolerance towards other people (and even themselves) when it comes to things like sex, and too much tolerance when it comes to things like violence."
[digressing]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt_9miKcszE "I tend to digress a lot, but that's another thing I have tried to be more mindful about in my writing. One of the ways I am able to do that is putting things like this in the title-text... But, people reading this on a mobile device can't read them at all! It's a major problem I hope to solve eventually."
[Lit]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXuVsGaywrA "When I have my own room (or I am sharing a room with a significant other exclusively) I do prefer to sleep naked. My parents usually did, and I was brought up knowing that it was okay. Yet in most games and many stories, they seem to sleep in their day clothes or armor, not even changing into pajamas!"
[nipples]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_the_Nipple_(campaign) "I have *seriously* never understood why exactly female nipples are not appropriate for the public when male nipples are. It is obviously a temporary social state, but it is also all I have ever known to exist on a societal level... And no one has ever been able to come up with even a semi-satisfying explanation for how this came to be. I mean, even when looking at the events that left things like this in history... It's really just sloppy thinking on every level, and the idea in the first place making no sense just compounds with it to make it mind numbingly stupid."
[humanity]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHCGti6HeeI "This is a fairly hard thing to get across to people, especially people who've already decided how they feel about things such as violence or nudity. Denying those things that make us human is pointless and detrimental to our own health. Plus, it is actually a pretty dumb concept if You think about it for 5 seconds."
[fairly odd]: http://fairlyoddparents.wikia.com/wiki/Crimson_Chin "Furthermore, I personally don't like how people just pretend that we have come *so* far from our more primitive origins. We really haven't, and that is okay: The human experience is made through balance, and balancing decency and vulgarity is paramount to living a full life."
