Below is the table I've created on my local computer to house the
pieces I play regularly on the Electric Bass.

The first column, __Card__, is special: As part of my practice, I
assign each regular piece to a playing card in one of many decks. This
way, if I want to be challenged / practice something randomly, I just
draw from a deck and get playing. It is meant to keep me practicing
more during practice time, and also to get me to play pieces I would
otherwise forget about. I'll talk more about that in another post
sometime.

The collection presented here I made because it is all of the pieces I
have learned to play for a band I am currently a part of. I'll add to
it soon, but I wanted to get this done first because of the fact that
I play these pieces with others.
