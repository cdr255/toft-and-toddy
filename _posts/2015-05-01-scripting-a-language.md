The highlight of my work yesterday was sifting through my
[Conlang][conlang] work so I could put it on my new site.

_(NB. If You are wondering, after discovering how much work I had to
do yet, I pushed back the launch until Monday, May 4th.)_

I grew up reading a lot of [Fantasy][fantasy]: [Tolkien][tolk],
[Pierce][pierce], and [Duane][duane] were some of my favorite authors,
and I read a good number of [Forgotten Realms][fr] and
[Dragonlance][dr] books as well. I was very influenced by my new-found
love of [Fantasy][fantasy], and one area which sticks out to me _to
this day_ is my fascination with fictitious cultures.

I know, I know... No big surprise given my work and this blog.

But anyway, one thing I have noticed and appreciated in fiction is how
much legitimacy a [Constructed Language][conlang] can lend to a group
of characters. I don't know what it is about a few odd looking words,
but knowing that they don't speak [American English][ameng] always
made them seem more real to me, as I read.

[Tengwar][tengwar] and [Tradertalk][tt] stick out very vividly in my
mind. As does [The Speech][speech], which to this day is still my
favorite [Magic System][magicsys] in fiction or in games. Even when I
book didn't have specific words from the language printed, and merely
referenced the fact that the words _were_ in a different language, it
was still so vivid in my young (and still in my current) mind.

So, naturally, as I began to try to tell my own stories, I wanted to
try my hand at it as well.

And, I must admit, I have not gotten too far with it yet... I don't
really [know anyone][fictlang] who is into this, and while I don't
consider myself stupid, I don't really know much about making a
language yet. Aside from a few very specific concepts, I haven't
really defined any of my languages to the point where I might call
them even usable in a book.

I find the task daunting, but exhilarating... and monumental in
scope, like a towering pillar of stairs that I need to climb. I don't
have the aptitude for it, yet, but I am slowly learning and honing the
skills that I'll need to create full and complex languages, maybe even
on the same level as [Hymmnos][hymmnos], or [Klingon][klingon], one
day. For now, I still sit in quiet admiration of those that have come
before me.

What I _have_ discovered I have a liking and aptitude for is
[Constructing Scripts][conscripts]. Writing systems, or the way of
recording, visually, a language, have in many ways resonated with me
more than spoken language... or even language as a whole. I've toyed
with many systems over the years, and putting them together (usually
just as a cipher for American English or similar) is always an
interesting process for me.

The way a culture of people record information says a lot about
them. Ancient Irish/Celtic people carved their words into stone, and
only needed to commit the inarguable- who owned which plot of land,
how big it was, etc.- leaving the rest to be preserved through word of
mouth and the [Oral Tradition][oral]. Their [writing system][writing],
thus, was made to suit short, terse messages and come easily to a
chisel. Contrast that with another well known ancient system,
[Elder and Younger Futhark][futhark], which was used by Germanic
peoples up until c. 1200 CE: Individual Glyphs which could easily be
painted or written without losing the rigidity of form that carving
provides, because of the Nordic people's fascination with laws and
written records.

And then, compare _that_ to [Anglo-Fresian futhorc][futhorc], which
was eventually expanded up to 33 characters because of their use of
many different [phonemes][phonemes] (a result of their mingling of
many separate different cultures and in general their conquest/conquer
history) before it was succeeded by [Latin][latin]... _except_ for the
characters which represented those phonemes, which were used up until
the 13th century, and some (notably
[ß](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9F) and
[Þ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorn_%28letter%29)) still survive in
some form to this day.

Sorry, that was a __big__ digression there. _(NB. All my own
speculation, by the way... YMMV)_ But that kind of thing (how and why
a language is created and used) has so many implications on the
history and culture of a people. It is something that really draws me
into a story, and indeed, into a world. I noticed that feeling, going
through my old scripts today, and I wanted to share it with You.

[conlang]: http://conlang.org/ "Constructed Languages are a large part of building a deep, believable world for me. It never made sense that people who lived in a world without Rome or England would speak English and write in the Latin Alphabet."
[fantasy]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy "Fantasy is my favorite big genre in books. Sci-fi is a close second: I definitely appreciate how the tech of the future can comment on the present, but I prefer philosophical and culture questions posed in a fictional universe, and I like swords, shields, and esoterica."
[tolk]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien "I have grown to have a few major problems with his books, but there is no denying the lasting influence he had on the landscape of modern Fantasy. And despite those major problems, the books (and the stories they tell) are very good."
[pierce]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamora_Pierce "I think I've said it before in a title text, but Tamora Pierce is one of the most influential authors in my life. Her books, along with Diane Duane's and a few others, made lasting impressions on me that continue to this day."
[duane]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Duane "Diane Duane, and her 'So You Want to be a Wizard' series, provided a counterpoint I desperately needed to the conworlded, high magic, low tech settings I was reading in other books (Like Tamora Pierce's). Though less in number, there is no denying the effect these books had on me as a child... and that those effects are still present in the man I am today."
[fr]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Forgotten_Realms_novels "Forgotten Realms... What can I say? The setting I started Role-playing in, the setting some of my favorite Video Games were set in, the setting You can always fall back on if things go South. I have largely moved on from it, but it is very fun to revisit, if only for a short time."
[dr]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_novels "I never got too into Dragonlance, but I did read a book or Five. I liked certain things about them: The world was well defined, it felt truly different than Forgotten Realms, and I will admit that I like Kender. But the culture *surrounding* the books (and the *rabid* nature some of the fans take towards advocating them) kind of scared me off."
[ameng]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "One of the reasons I have always preferred reading fantasy as opposed to watching fantasy, I guess. Though in movies, they often use British English instead... though I suppose that is equally as bad, because there is no reason for them to be speaking English at all."
[tengwar]: http://omniglot.com/writing/tengwar.htm "Something about Tolkien's languages makes them feel mystical. Is it the books they appear in? The odd and nuanced writing systems? The dialects? Probably all of them. But regardless, I like tengwar... though if I had to choose, I would probably learn Quenya instead."
[tt]: http://tamorapierce.wikia.com/wiki/Trader#Terminology "Tradertalk is one of those languages which is not unified or complete, but instead introduced using important concepts and terms throughout the character's experiences. When someone actually *speaks* in it, it becomes like The Speech and is only referenced in the background."
[speech]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speech "There was never a single word of the Speech printed in any of the books (And there was actually a very thoughtful in-character reason for that, too!). But it was dealt with well, like a real language, and that made it more real than I thought it would."
[magicsys]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_System "Most people prefer the Vancian system of magic, because of its proliferation in other media (DND, Video Games, etc). I have always felt a deep and unrelenting fascination towards any variety of Truespeech, and this was my first encounter with it."
[fictlang]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2012/09/12/forgive-me-father "I am a pretty antisocial person when it comes down to it, I think. I don't often go out, I don't have a huge amount of friends I see or talk to on a regular basis, and I don't really mind, most of the time. Odd, I suppose."
[hymmnos]: http://hymmnoserver.uguu.ca/ "This is the language from the world of Ar Tonelico, and is in fact another example of a magic language (sort of). Anyway, it is beautiful, and has one of the most unique and interesting grammars that I have ever come across."
[klingon]: http://www.kli.org/ "Klingon is the one that people usually suggest when I mention conlangs. I wonder what about it, specifically, makes it so well known. I mean, Star Trek is popular, but is it *really* more popular than the works of J.R.R. Tolkien? I dunno. But people definitely know it exists."
[conscripts]: http://www.omniglot.com/conscripts/ "I really, really wanted to mention Al Bhed, the eponymous language from Spira's Al Bhed in Final Fantasy, but that is neither a constructed language (it is a cipher of English) nor a constructed script (it uses the English Alphabet still). Oh well."
[oral]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_tradition "Though I definitely enjoy writing systems more in the context of a language, as a *musician* I am much more familiar with the Oral Tradition than I am with the writing system (though I am familiar enough with it to read and write it). I prefer to learn by ear."
[writing]: http://www.omniglot.com/writing/ogham.htm "The writing system I am talking about here is called Beth Luis Nion, and also referred to as Ogham. It is very interestingly different, with all of the characters on a line. I borrowed some of the concepts it uses for my Constructed Script, 'Vinescript'."
[futhark]: http://www.omniglot.com/writing/runic.htm "Though there is a lot of (mostly silly) modern divination centered around Runes, remember that they *were* a writing system at one point. They were not originally used the way they largely are today."
[futhorc]: http://omniglot.com/writing/futhorc.htm "This was very interesting to me; It shows how easily a culture's history can be represented in a language, and how the language can imply certain things about the history of its speakers. "
[phonemes]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoneme "Phonemes are what I am currently working on, actually. I keep getting stuck on differentiating between the IPA and phonemes in general, and it is made more difficult by the fact that I don't really know the IPA yet."
[latin]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet#Classical_Latin_alphabet "It is so funny to me that, historically, the Latin Alphabet beat out so many others. Think about it for a second, think of how many different systems it displaced over the years. Hey, it is kind of like English!"
