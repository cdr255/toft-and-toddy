I have just recently re-done my [Patreon][patreon] page.

It's not so much that I want to (or **need** to) make
[more money][money]. I am more interested in a few
[side effects][sideeffects] of maintaining a [Patreon][patreon] page
than I am of the idea that people might [pledge][pledge] support for
my work... [side effects][sideeffects] that will only grow in number
as I go on with it.

Firstly (and most importantly, to me) is the idea that it is (yet
again) another [collection][collection] of my work. However, this is
different from my [blog posts][toft], [serial blog][prose], and
[soundcloud][soundcloud] in that it won't be focused just on one
medium (short reflections, serial fiction, and music, respectively) of
my work, but instead will encompass everything I do. And while yes,
that *is* the point of my [website][cdr255], it is different form
*that* in that it will be organized by date instead of content type.

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

In short, it will be an easy and quick way to prove to myself how much
I am [getting things done][gtd], and how much of what I do is
[busy work][busywork].

Secondly, it will give people (should they [choose][choice] to use it,
of course) a single, unified place to [comment][comment] on my
work... [Raising questions][questions], [sharing ideas][ideas],
[giving feedback][feedback]. This is something I have wanted for a
while, but have never really been [able][excuses] to set up (largely
because my work is spread out across multiple platforms, dashing any
communities that might spring up around them).

I make these things because it is what I want (and
[need, on some levels][why]) to do. But knowing others might be
enjoying them, or at least hearing / reading them, would make it all
the better for me. And hey, I try to
[improve with each project][improvement] I work on... but I know I'd
improve a lot more if more people saw the things I put out.

Finally, and this is sort of a personal benefit, there is the concept
of a [deadline][deadline].

I don't want to follow an explicit deadline for my [blog][toft],
[fiction][prose], or [soundcloud][soundcloud], but following one for
my [blog][toft], [fiction][prose], *and*
[soundcloud][soundcloud]... That could work better. Especially if I
don't limit it to just those things, and count things like
[artwork][tumblr] and [project][github] updates.

Setting up a [semi-regular schedule][semiregular] of posting to
[Patreon][patreon] will allow me to take all of the different areas I
work in, and combine them into a single [deadline][deadline] that I
can [check myself][checkyourself] against. This'll make sure that, no
matter where my day takes me insofar as work, I will be working
towards a single [deadline][deadline]... which, in theory, should make
me more [productive][productive].

Anyway, I spent a good hour or two over the last two days working on
it, so I wanted to discuss it here. What do You think?

[patreon]: https://www.patreon.com/cdr255 "Patreon is a service I think could work wonders, given the right support. It is having some difficulties with international customers, and is also not exactly an institution by any means, but it could easily get to the point of kickstarter if enough people hop on the train."
[money]: http://www.girlswithslingshots.com/comic/gws-chaser-41/ "Of course, I won't *mind* it if I get some supporters... but I am not doing this with that explicit purpose. I actually had some difficulties coming up with the reward levels, because I forgot they were a thing until I was nearly done re-branding my campaign. Hope I did a good enough job, future supporters!"
[sideeffects]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Recap/StevenUniverseS1E42WinterForecast "In two other big areas of my life byproducts are very prominent: Computer Science (particularly video games, where they are the crux of the entire idea, especially in functional programming) and in Cooking (where I not only use a lot of byproducts like gelatin or whey, but I also reap the benefits of a lot of byproducts, like using yeast for leavening)."
[pledge]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pledge "There are actually a surprisingly decent amounts of things called pledges. I like the idea of a system based on people's honor for supporting the arts, even though I am a hardened cynic most of the time. It just resonates with me."
[collection]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magpie "I am basically a large, featherless magpie when it comes to collecting things, especially in lists. One of these days I'll have the perfect list of everything I've done, and I'll post it on this blog... which will then ruin the list, so I'll have to re-make it..."
[toft]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/ "The blog needs to have a fluid schedule because, if I get the inspiration to work on something with a more substantial impact on my stories I should be able to put it on the back-burner for the time it takes to finish that. Also, these posts take a fair amount of time to make, as I have said before."
[prose]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/ "Prose and Prosody needs to have a fluid schedule because, if I need to rework something, finish something, or throw something out, I need to be able to do that without sacrificing my goals of high quality and improving myself. Also, I need time to fully realize the concepts for the stories before writing them."
[soundcloud]: https://soundcloud.com/cdr255/ "My Soundcloud needs to have a fluid schedule because, in the end, I make most of my money as a musician. If I don't think something is worth posting, or if I spend most of my day playing and teaching and I am burned out, I need time to make my compositions and recordings sound good. Also, though I am trying to post more, I don't want to just fill it up with covers and arrangements."
[cdr255]: https://cdr255.herokuapp.com/ "My new website is finished and being updated as new things come out, but the domain is not transferred yet. It should be up within a week or so; for now, use this address."
[gtd]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done "I need to feel productive, otherwise I get depressed and very unhappy with life. So, I try to eliminate busy work where I can, and focus on an AGILE-style stream of small products that will combine into a larger one eventually."
[busywork]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=busy+work "Busy work is something I have always had very little patience for, even in high school (Yes, that caused a lot of problems for me). So, in order to keep myself from creating busy work for myself, I try to check myself constantly and make sure I am productive."
[choice]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PleaseSubscribeToOurChannel "None of my finished, published work will ever be behind a mandatory pay-wall. I will never force my supporters to comment, sign up, or subscribe. If I am supported, I want it to be based on my merits, and the merits of my work... not keep-away or blackmail."
[comment]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyqLdYeD-gU "I have, in general, received very little feedback on most of what I have put out there. Because of that (and to make it easier to keep up with) I want it all to be in one place."
[questions]: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html "Some of the best feedback I've gotten from people, especially Ethan and Rachel, was in the form of questions they had about certain things I had glossed over or assumed about the reader. This is the kind of feedback I like the most."
[ideas]: http://janefriedman.com/2011/10/19/idea-theft/ "Bouncing ideas around is very important: Give the same melody, or the same title, to two different musicians and You will get back two very different pieces. I've come up with a lot of my best work jamming and spit-balling with people over tea or a video game."
[feedback]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/evolution-the-self/200906/criticism-vs-feedback-which-one-wins-hands-down-part-1 "In general, feedback is a great, great thing for me- provided it is constructive, and not critical for criticism's sake. Feedback is great, criticism isn't usually a good thing... especially in unfinished works. In the end, I am the one at the helm, so if I disagree with something You say I won't adopt it. And you know what? That's okay. You should do the same (unless You disagree, of course)."
[excuses]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r80HF68KM8g "This is a pretty big excuse. I could easily start uploading my work to Reddit, or some other big community site more focused around stuff like this. But I haven't yet. Patreon will really be my first."
[why]: http://allpoetry.com/So-You-Want-To-Be-A-Writer "I like the advice given by Charles Bukowski in this poem. A lot of people want to be a musician or a writer because of *reasons*, or other eventualities they think come with the territory. If You can choose not to be an artist of some kind, do it. I would go crazy if I stopped playing and writing, so I have no choice but to get better."
[improvement]: http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/42-practical-ways-to-improve-yourself.html "It is important, in every discipline, to constantly strive to improve Yourself. Not because it will make You sell better; not because it is a way to get praise or fans. But because You owe it to Yourself and those who support You to put out the best stuff You can."
[deadline]: http://www.lifehack.org/articles/productivity/22-tips-for-effective-deadlines.html "I am someone who has always worked well under stress, particularly the stress of a (reasonable) deadline. I am hoping that this idea will work to my advantage, and make it so that I finish more stuff in general... and therefore improve faster."
[tumblr]: http://susurrussweven.tumblr.com/ "This is, hereafter, a place where I am going to upload my graphic art. Backgrounds, Album Covers, Paintings, etc... Mostly stuff made in GIMP, or scanned through GIMP in any case. Though I have been looking at Krita lately. Hmm..."
[github]: https://github.com/cdr255/ "Maybe the fact that I might be able to use project updates to fill in the deadline for the day will make my software projects progress faster and further. I hope so, anyway."
[semiregular]: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/phil-simon/why-i-dont-blog-every-day_b_4545060.html "Semi-regular means that I *mean* to post every day... but if I miss a day or two here or there, it doesn't matter as much as it otherwise would. I'd ask You to be nice about it, but I know I won't be when I miss a day, so go nuts, I guess."
[checkyourself]: http://www.eruptingmind.com/the-importance-of-examining-your-beliefs/ "It is important to examine Yourself as You do things. Never assume You know anything, especially not based on past-held opinions or ideas. Always be open to change, because to change is to live."
[productive]: https://xkcd.com/874/ "I personally want to have a large body of work under my belt by the end of the year. I've been pretty good about working towards that goal, but I am hoping that I can do better in the second half of the year. See You on the other side!"
