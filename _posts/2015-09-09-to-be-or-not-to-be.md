I recently had a bit of an [argument][argument] with one of my best
friends.

We were talking about [sexuality][sexuality], specifically. And, while
I was mulling over the conversation a bit later, I realized something:
We weren't arguing over [sexuality][sexuality] itself, but rather over
the difference between a state and an identity: We were arguing over
using the verb "[to be][is]".

<!-- more -->

Let me explain a bit more. Basically, when someone says the
"[are][is]" a certain thing, or someone says so and so "[is][is]" a
certain thing, they are using a kind of mental [shorthand][shorthand].
They aren't saying that this is all they will ever be, or that this is
all they ever were. They are saying that, in [this moment][oneshot],
they fit the description of that thing.

Examples: Saying "Sally is boring." We aren't presupposing nothing
interesting can ever really come from Sally. We aren't saying that she
is worthless, or a [stick in the mud][stick], from her birth until her
death. What we are really saying is that we *find* her boring, in this
moment. We are saying she is interested in things which we *consider*
boring, or are *uninterested* in. Or, that she is *uninterested* in
the things we enjoy.

Saying it that way is [more difficult][easy language] (and takes
longer), but it is much more [precise][accuracy vs precision]. It
makes more sense, because it doesn't write off Sally forever... And it
even shows that her "being boring" might be [on You][blame], and not
on her.

Another Example: "Stan is a Scientist." That isn't to say Stan doesn't
take science seriously.  But in this
[thought experiment][thought experiment], at least, all Stan has is
his work in Science: Not his husband, not his
[rock collection][geology], not his love of romantic poetry or
extensive prowess concerning [Euro-style board games][eurogames]. We
know that he studies science, but not which area he specializes in
([Mycology][mycology]), nor what exactly he *does* in that field (experimental
hybrid research).

Worse, though: Most of us would have some [preconceptions][prejudice] about Stan as
a person. Scientists tend to be considered *intelligent,
single-minded, and social outcasts* on the surface, whereas Stan is
definitely more *creative, observant, and sociable*. Some people might
think him an Atheist (He is a practicing Buddhist), others might
assume he works for a university (He is a full partner in a start up).

My point here is that saying he "is a Scientist" puts [him into a
box][box]... and a pretty ill-defined [box][box] at that.

One final example: "Beth is [Demisexual][demi]." This is a touchy one,
and I by no means am trying to imply that people should do anything
they don't want to do... Nor am I trying to say that Your [sexual
identity][sexual identity] is wrong in any way (particularly if Your name is
Beth... this is just an example to illustrate the point I am getting
at).

Saying something like this, especially about someone else, is two
things at once: It is a quick way to assign a certain set of
preferences and lifestyle choices to a person based around a
definition and a stereotype. And it is a way to judge any choices the
person might make in the future, and hold their past and future up to
scrutiny based on that definition and stereotype.

Let me explain these individually. The first point ties into the point
I made with Stan: Basically, giving someone an [epithet][epithet]
means assigning them a lot of things, based on history,
[prejudice][prejudice], and the personal experience whoever is
involved has with the [epithet][epithet]. When it is something as
personal and individual as [sexuality][sexual identity], using a term
like that can be a simple way to denote a general idea of how one
person might express their [sexuality][sexuality], who they might be
interested in, and even what they might be willing to talk about on a
more intellectual or [platonic][platonic] level.

I want to draw attention to my use of the term "might" in the previous
paragraph. That, in essence, is the point I am hoping to drive home
here: The [labels][labels] we use (even granular ones like
[demisexual][demi], [sapiosexual][sapio], or [pansexual][pan]) are
only sufficient to describe people up to a point- and though I am
using [sexuality][sexuality] as my example here, that is (by far) not
the only place that this distinction exists. After the
[labels][labels] are used, to *truly* understand the reason they use
that label is by *talking* to them about it.

That's not to say that [labels][labels] are bad, or wrong, or
insufficient: For some people, they work perfectly and give them a
sense of [camaraderie][sexual identity] that a longer description
might not. For others, they are perfectly accurate in their entirety,
and nothing more really needs to be said. And if either one of those
describes You, that's great!  I'm not trying to say there is
*anything* wrong with that.

What I'm trying to say is that, in my life, I've run across people who
used this [label][labels] or that [label][labels], but with some
differences here or there... And *that* is great, too. There is
*nothing* wrong with that, either... But had I just accepted the
original statement, that Beth was a [demisexual][demi], I would never
have learned that she is only really comfortable getting physically
intimate with women, too. I would have simply assumed that all of the
general aspects of [demisexuality][demi] applied to her, and I would
have been *wrong*.

In speaking, labels offer a simple way to paint in broad strokes about
something, especially when You don't know much about them... or don't
want to get too into a subject. In writing, it is oftentimes better to
simply leave the label out entirely (except in dialogue, of course),
and just give an evidenced, colorful definition. It is a classic case
of Show, don't Tell.

This brings me to my second point: 

I've seen examples of people being held under scrutiny because their
actions didn't quite mesh with the [words][labels] they'd used to
describe themselves (inside and outside the scope of
[sexuality][sexuality], for the record). As a [pedant][pedant], I can
understand how that might be a bit annoying, but I find the practice
of [shaming][shaming] someone for being themselves to be even more
annoying than incorrect verbiage. Whether or not they are behaving
appropriately according to the letter of the definition is really
immaterial; they obviously felt it was right at some point, or they
wouldn't have described themselves in that way.

In short, and to reiterate the above, putting people into [boxes][box]
against their will is a bad thing... and keeping them there against
their will is even worse.

To close, I just want to reaffirm here that this essay was not really
about [sexuality][sexuality], per se. It was about the verb "is", and
it's limiting factors (for many things, including
[sexuality][sexuality]) in the English language. I tried my best to
make the examples inclusive, and I hope I have not hurt anyone's
feelings or tread on anyone's identities with any of them. If I have,
I apologize, and I'm more than willing to retract or amend any such
faux pas, once it is brought to my attention (comments below).

The verb "[is][is]" is such an issue that people have tried to
[remove it][eprime] entirely from the English Language. I am not
suggesting that that is the way to go, nor am I even suggesting that
it is a good idea to begin with... But it's worth noting that people
have done it.

When I've discussed things as of late, I've tried my best to avoid the
word "is" as much as possible. It's led me to think about interesting
ideas that I'd otherwise have taken for granted, redefine how I view
certain ideals and concepts, and even reconsider some of my own
longstanding positions on various things.

You should give it a try. At the very least, it **is** a good
[thought experiment][thought experiment]. (Or rather, it might provoke
a different point of view in your daily life).


[argument]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y "Argument meaning discussion, here. One of the main ways I like to communicate is arguing; I like considering different opinions, hearing different points of view and thoughts, and growing together with others. I argue a lot, though most of the time I would not really consider those to be fights."
[sexuality]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_sexuality "Sexuality being what it is in this rather convoluted modern world, I do find it to be a fairly difficult thing to talk about. It is largely something I keep to myself, which is why I don't write about it very often... But as an example of the specific failing I'm talking about in the English language here, it was clearly the best example. Runners up would have been something like the Autism Spectrum (which I am much less familiar with), and Gaming (which I felt lacked the same gravitas as either of my previous topics. So, I decided (after many days) to stick with sexuality. I in no way intended to neglect, erase, or offend anyone with this subject. YMMV (I mean, just look at the state of the Wiki page!)"
[shorthand]: http://gregg.angelfishy.net/ "I was always enraptured by the idea of shorthand, simply because of its many various uses for note taking. But, when I began to learn it, I found it more difficult and time consuming to write in than my already illegible, already faster-than-script printing... And so, since I could read my own printing, I decided to abandon that for a while."
[oneshot]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmXumtgwtak "This is largely where I think a lot of the fuzziness of the word 'is' lies: Though the literal definition implies a current state, the colloquial one has evolved to be deliberately ambiguous in regards to a time-frame."
[stick]: http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0824.html "With regards to a lot of things, I have fit this description before: I don't drink, don't smoke, don't partake in any kind of recreational drug, like numbers and order, and don't really like wantonly breaking rules. I've become a bit less stuck as I've aged... but by no means have I escaped the mud."
[easy language]: https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity "This is the larger problem I am currently grappling with in this essay: The idea of informal language, and its ambiguity. More in a later post, to be certain."
[accuracy vs precision]: http://www.mathsisfun.com/accuracy-precision.html "This was something my dad taught me very early on in my life, using the classic bulls-eye metaphor: A tightly grouped cluster of arrows is precise, whereas a looser grouping around the bulls-eye is accurate. Most people interchange those two words, when in reality they are very important (but separate) traits to consider in and out of the lab."
[blame]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-blame-game "So often people use the verb 'to be' to assign blame: Cabbage is yucky, Computers are boring, etc etc. In reality, what they are saying is they don't enjoy the texture of cabbage, and they find computers to be daunting in their complexity... But instead, people put the blame on the object, instead of on themselves. It's actually pretty interesting from a psychological perspective."
[thought experiment]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment "I perhaps enjoy thought experiments a bit too much for practicality's sake... But I do find them to be one of the most enjoyable parts of my life. I've started a tag here for them, so I am sure I'll talk more about my thought experiments in the future."
[geology]: http://www.amnh.org/ology/features/stufftodo_earth/rockcollection_main.php "My brother used to collect rocks. I was never really into it, though I remember with bated breath those stores where You could purchase a very small quantity of this mineral or that mineral, complete with a small velvet back to hold it in and a card explaining what exactly it was. For some reason, I preferred the stories around the stones to the stones themselves."
[eurogames]: https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame "Euro Style board games are very interesting to me, though I can understand why they have gotten the reputation that they have in recent years. Perhaps relating to the stick-in-the-mud title text, I do enjoy a well thought out, inclusive experience involving many different point totals and avenues to pursue. More on this later."
[mycology]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycology "Mycology has interested me since I was young, though I never took biology very seriously. Perhaps it is my love of language that prevented me from doing so; I simply could not accept that the bulk of my learning would be an arbitrary yet rigid system of organization and names which I had no control over. At least with physics (my preferred science) I could *do* something with what I was learning... Biology was simply too much by rote for my tastes."
[prejudice]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prejudice "I feel as though people assume prejudice is a natural and okay thing in certain cases, but a bogeyman in others. I think we need to take it for what it is: A pre-judgment. And, when You take it that way, most prejudices become silly to the point where people no longer really try to defend them, because they realize how silly they are being. I wish that that simple thought experiment was actually practical. More on this later."
[box]: http://thoughtcatalog.com/alexia-lafata/2013/12/lets-stop-putting-people-in-boxes/ "This is where the argument mentioned above really hit me as something special. Putting people in a box, especially a box they can't easily escape, is usually a bad thing. I'll make a real post about this some other time, but basically boxes are labels gone wrong, in my mind."
[demi]: http://demisexuality.org/articles/what-is-demisexuality/ "Demisexuality is something I feel is very overlooked and misunderstood in even the more progressive areas of the internet. It's a very simple concept, at least in my eyes... Perhaps it is the lack of exposure that leads to the confusion some people have surrounding it."
[sexual identity]: http://kinseyconfidential.org/sexual-identity-sexual-orientation/ "I in no way, shape, or form am trying to say that *your* sexuality is wrong, limited, overlooked, repressed, not real, different, or even accurate. I want to make that very clear. I'm only using sexuality here because it is such a great example of why the verb 'is' is a tricky one in our language: Because sexuality is so diverse and varied that pinning it down for everyone is very difficult. You are perfect with whatever labels You've chosen to use, including if You've chosen to use none."
[epithet]: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/epithet "I actually prefer the term epithet to the term label, because it is more accurate. A 'label' is something used to describe something, whereas an epithet is a title or descriptive phrase attributed to a person. To be clear: We are really talking about epithets in this essay."
[platonic]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_love "I would really like to point out here that there are meaningful platonic relationships in life. Those, I feel, are the most neglected kinds of relationship... and I thought they deserved an explicit mention. And yes, Your sexuality might influence Your platonic life, too. How? Think about it, it is different for everyone."
[labels]: https://sugarandslugs.wordpress.com/2011/01/16/in-defense-of-labels/ "Really, what I am talking about here is an epithet. But either way, I want to take this space to say even more explicitly that there is NOTHING WRONG with labels, for what they are. Labels are great tools for meeting people, describing Yourself and others quickly, and even learning more about Yourself and the world around You. However, as someone for whom labels have failed in the past, I personally have to point out that they are not for everyone and can easily make life more difficult than it needs to be if they are taken too much to heart."
[sapio]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sapiosexual "Sapiosexuality is another term that has relatively little public awareness associated with it, even less so than demisexuality."
[pan]: http://www.stop-homophobia.com/pansexuality.htm "Pansexuality is a fairly maligned term in popular consciousness. It's a good example here because most people have heard of it today, but many misunderstand it."
[shaming]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slut-shaming "Shaming anyone simply for being what they are is (note the three uses of the infamous verb, there) reprehensible, in my opinion. Outside of the realm of things which hurt others, why do we care if so and so is not living the way we think that they should? Furthermore, is it really so important that You need to take the time to personally ruin their day, and cast their own self worth into jeopardy? Are You really *that* bored and underemployed in life?"
[eprime]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Prime "E-Prime is a great, interesting, and difficult-to-use alternate ruleset for English which completely removes the verb in question (to be) from the language. Link goes there."
[is]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_and_acquittal_of_Bill_Clinton "Here, this, this is the crux of the issue (as it usually amounts to the problems I have expressing myself in this language): The verb 'To Be'. One of the most used verbs in the lexicon, it attracts a sort of ambiguity that I find quite difficult to deal with, especially in regards to casual conversation. I'll write a more in depth post about it later... this one has already become too long by half."
[pedant]: http://goats.com/index.php?id=31 "I am still a card-carrying pedant, though I have learned it is often better to just let others speak incorrectly than to try to correct them all of the time. It saves headaches, bad feelings, and more!"
