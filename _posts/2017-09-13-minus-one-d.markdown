A few months ago (briefly before I was going to head off to my first
Pennsic War) my 3DS finally broke badly enough that I couldn't justify
fixing it. 

There now a problem with the aftermarket battery and charger I used to
avoid swapping the charging port on the thing. But worse: the 3D
effect on the top screen would also switch rapidly (and randomly)
between fully off (0% 3D) and fully on (100% 3D), no matter where I
had the slider. And this system was an *original* 3DS, from 2011â€¦ It
had no Amiibo support, no C stick, and no "New 3DS" game support.

In short, it was time for an upgrade.

Enter the New Nintendo 2DS XL. (Yes, that's an awful name compared to
"Game Boy", but still.)

I've only had it in my hands for about 12 hours at this point, so I
will give a more thorough review later on, but my initial impressions:

- It's lighter than I thought it would be. 
- WOW, that screen is nice and *big*. 
- Battery life is impressive. 
- Weird placement for the speakers. 
- Easy-to-access expandable storage (phone companies, take note).
- Power Button is hard to press
- Stylus is nice to hold.

The system transfer was really easy, too. I'll be honest and say I was
a bit nervous about it. But it was as simple as copying over the
contents of my SD card.

It's good to have a 3DS again. Especially now that it's missing my
least favorite D.
