It is very easy to write about overt, heavy, high magic fantasy.

One thing that makes the [Pathfinder][pathfinder] setting,
[Golarion][golarion], a bit hard to believe for me is how high magic
everything is. [Golarion][golarion] was their answer to
[Forgotten Realms][forgotten realms], and they decided to take it one
step further (in a very [Marvel][marvel] kind of way) as they were
creating it. It feels extremely... extreme. Like fireworks in the
middle of the night, on New Year's Eve.

And don't get me wrong: There is nothing **wrong** with that. I
appreciate that it is different; [Forgotten Realms][forgotten realms]
is getting very tired in its old age, in my opinion. From a **gaming**
perspective, it is fine for me.

It's from a **writing** perspective that I start to have issues.
{% raw %}
<!-- WROTE THIS ACCIDENTALLY, SAVE FOR SLOW DAY? -->

<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

I live, or at least I try to live, [very deliberately][thoreau]. Which,
when it comes down to it, I feel is one of my strongest and most
pronounced traits. Everything I do, from brushing my teeth to working
on this blog, is very deliberate. There are [mistakes][mistakes],
sure. After all, I am only human. But nothing is accidental.

I am deeply enamored with the [small things][small] in life: I like
to [crochet][crochet], [cook][cook], [mend clothes][clothes],
[wash clothes][laundry], and
[other such mundane things][other]. Something about those little
necessities feels so human, so alive to me. It makes me happy to exist
**here**, and I would not trade that for many things.

In a way, this is one of the things which drew me to things like the
[Circle of Magic][com] series when I was young, and led me to people
like [Ran Prieur][ran] as I grew up: I have a deep love for
[escapism][escapism], which is tempered only by my desire to live in
*this* reality as best as I can. I love the boring bits of life: The
grinding, the cooking, the mending, the traveling... But feel that,
even as I do these things, there's so much more going on there than
what it looks like.

[High Fantasy][fantasy] usually glosses over these boring bits, or
waves them away with a simple mention of the word
[magic][magic]. [Non-Fantasy][fiction] fiction, of course, doesn't
consider these actions important or special at all, and will usually
stick to the characters and the story events.

I think that, even on the most [Fantastic Voyage][fantastic] ever,
there will still be [chores][cleanup] to do. And in those unifying
acts are where the *real* magic happens. You can't ignore the
limitations of life and just focus on the exciting things, even when
You are talking about [dragons][dragons] or [spaceships][spaceships].

Yesterday, I saw an article on [brambles][brambles]- the plants that
grow things like [raspberries][rasp], [blackberries][black], and
[dewberries][dew]. When You look at how many of these bramble-fruits
are the result of us making [hybrids][hybrids] of the above three, or
realize that they are all closely related to another well known plant,
the [rose bush][rose], or that most of those same plant's leaves can
be used in [tisane][tisane]... that feeling You get when You realize
how deep small things can be?

**That** is the true fantasy to me, and as an [author][author] I want
to communicate that to my audience. I want them to see the world (and
life itself) the way I see it. I wrote a [story code][code] recently,
for my [serial blog][pandp]. And the point I just expanded
[here][thispost] is on there: In my stories, there should be __Beauty
and Magic in Mundanity__.

Just something that has been on my mind lately, and I thought I'd
write about it here, since it was a slow day yesterday


[pathfinder]: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ "Pathfinder is a great system, and I am actually gearing up to run a small campaign in it again. I was originally going to write my own setting, but found that I kept getting bogged down in details so much that I would never actually get a chance to play it... So, Golarion it is. Albeit, a fictional part of Golarion."
[golarion]: http://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Golarion "It is very interesting that, though they moved away from Forgotten Realms, they kept the concept of being the third planet from the Sun in a small galaxy far from the center of the universe. It made a lot of sense in Forgotten Realms, because the universe it existed in was sort of overlayed on our own, and in the past we were more in touch with this other universe. Hence the name. Golarion, however, does not have such a back story (to my knowledge). Maybe it was an easy concept to use?"
[forgotten realms]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms "Oh, Forgotten Realms. It really is probably the most widely used and ambitious fantasy setting in existence, with video games, books, and game supplements comprising a *huge* library of material to work with. I grew up with it, and it always seemed like a constant to me: There if I needed to rely on it, fine if I didn't."
[marvel]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Draw_Comics_the_Marvel_Way "I read this book a while back, when I was trying to get back into storytelling. It offers a very interesting perspective, and taught me a bunch of things. But, my point here is to reference how Golarion is basically Toril with the Marvel Way applied to it. Very interesting."
[thoreau]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden#Synopsis "This book, Walden, is one of the books I read as a young adult which I continuously find myself referencing in one oblique way or another. You could say that it helped to shape the man I am today, especially in regards to my goals and motivations."
[mistakes]: http://seanheritage.blogspot.com/2011/09/mistakes-yes-accidents-never.html "I am a firm believer that there are, in fact, things beyond our control. But, that does not make them forgivable, nor does it make them excusable: It simply makes them things we need to deal with as best we can. Thus, I prefer using the word mistake as opposed to accident in regular speech."
[small]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ht5RZpzPqw "I actually never really listened to blink 182 (aside from this one song) until I was in my 20s. I was largely into Progressive, Glam, and Psychedelic Rock as a teenager (for rock music anyway; I also listened to a lot of Folk and Traditional music), and thus was not up with the times until I met my friend Rachel, for the most part. Thanks, Rachel!"
[crochet]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crochet "Crochet is something that my grandmother taught me, while she was still around. I practice it today both because I genuinely enjoy doing it, and because it still makes me feel connected to her in some small way. Another case of the magic of mundanity, I suppose."
[cook]: http://ranprieur.com/misc.html "This was the first page of recipes I recall myself really trying to learn and understand, as a 16 year old. I had just gone vegetarian, and just gotten into Ran Prieur's work, so when I saw he had some recipes up I knew I needed to try them out."
[clothes]: http://zenhabits.net/edit-your-life-part-4-your-wardrobe/ "I am far passed due to go through my clothing and get rid of items I no longer need. I found an article about doing so, and thought I'd put it here as a reminder to myself and You that we can pear down our collection of clothes safely."
[laundry]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-service_laundry "I moved into an apartment last June, and ever since I have relied on using a laundromat to do my wash. I enjoy the peace and time it gives me to just work on something, so I dunno if I will go back to doing my laundry at home until I have to."
[other]: http://www.chorewars.com/ "This link is funny, and also an example of something which has never (even as a child) worked for me: Gamifying chores. I dunno what it is, but making chores have an artificial layer of stats over them simply never sat well with me. But, I do still reward myself for doing chores, at times."
[com]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_Magic "I've said it in another title-text before, but Tamora Pierce's Circle of Magic series is one of the most influential series I have ever read. In this case, it was the fact that magic in the series was done not through esoteric chants or bat guano, but instead through spinning thread, gardening, and cooking."
[ran]: http://ranprieur.com/ "Ran Prieur is what I would call a philosopher. He is a prolific blogger, who also wrote a lot of Essays as a younger adult. His most famous was entitle, 'How to Drop Out,' which is how I found him in the first place."
[escapism]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism "By this, I mean most of my interests: Fantasy, Video Games, Movies, Books, Concept Albums, Tabletop Role Playing, Science Fiction, TV Series... Everything I am a consumer of is one form of escapism or another, for me, aside from food (most of the time)."
[fantasy]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy "I am a bigger fan of Fantasy than I am of Science Fiction for one main reason: Science Fiction tends to be based around things and how people react to them, whereas fantasy tends to be about people and how they react to one another. Both are fine, and I like both of them in their place... but I prefer the interactions between people than people's reactions to things, as a rule."
[magic]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_(paranormal) "To continue from the last title text (fantasy): I am very tired, however, of Fantasy's habit of completely explaining away certain things people use or need to do with a catch all 'a wizard did it' style answer. That is one area which Science Fiction is definitely superior to Fantasy, as a whole: They will usually come up with more believable solutions to everyday problems than 'Technology did it'."
[fiction]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiction#Reality_and_fiction "For all of my bashing of magic in this article, I feel it is necessary to add that I find 'realistic' fiction to be fairly boring, as a general rule. I like to confront things I could never experience in my fiction, and in most realistic fiction, I *could* do what the main character is doing, if I felt like dealing with the consequences of doing it. In fantasy, most of the situations are inaccessible to me for one reason or another. Science Fiction too. So, I prefer those for the most part."
[fantastic]: http://en.wikipedia.org/Fantastic_Voyage "I was originally going to link David Bowie's song, 'Fantastic Voyage,' here... but I thought this was more apropos, in the end. Even if we eventually could do what they do in this movie, if we were gone long enough we would need to deal with certain things that were glossed over in the movie due to the fact that, well... it was a movie. I have an odd interest in how those things might be dealt with, I guess. The movie (and the song) rocks, though!"
[cleanup]: https://outofthebluebox.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/they-still-have-plumbers/ "One of my first memories with modern Dr. Who is when Rose, on the station in 'End of the World', runs into an alien whose job it is to check the vents, as a plumber. That is the kind of thing I am advocating for, in this post."
[dragons]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon "As interesting an idea as Dragons are, I personally am close to adding them to the same list of overused tropes as Zombies, Vampires, and Werewolves are on for me. There are plenty more mythological creatures with historical basis that we could use, too, people. Don't overexpose the dragons!"
[spaceships]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Enterprise "Star Trek's ship, the USS Enterprise (in all of its forms) is a very interesting setting for a show to me. It does do a good job of injecting a mundane, workplace-like-setting with enough Space Opera feel to be interesting... But it also does so eclectically, adding things in the ad hoc way the show is known for. I dunno."
[brambles]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bramble "'Bramble' is definitely my word of the day. I finally have a word I can use to describe all of my favorite fruits at once, other than 'berries!'"
[rasp]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry "Raspberries are probably my favorite common fruit. I love how tart they are, and the fact that they are smaller than blackberries. My Grandmother preferred Raspberries, as well."
[black]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry "My best friend, Rachel, and my dad both prefer blackberries to raspberries. To please both of us, I suppose a boysenberry would work? Since it is a 1:1 hybrid of black- and raspberries?"
[dew]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewberry "I have never had a dewberry, though it looks to be similar to / a cross between a blackberry and a raspberry. This looks like a job for delicious, delicious science."
[hybrids]: http://thefruitnut.com/2012/07/19/rubus-diversity-and-obscurity/ "I was surprised, much like I was for broccoli et. al, with just how many different fruits are derived from the same three plants. That is another bit of mundane magic for You, and one that is very distinctly human. We are very good at breeding other living things to be a certain way."
[rose]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose#Cut_flowers "So, in a way, we use rose petals, rose flowers, rose stems, rose hips, rose leaves, and rose fruit in our modern American cuisine. We love the rose bush, in all of its forms."
[tisane]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbal_tea "'Tisane' is a more accurate word for 'Herbal Tea'. It never struck me as logical to define something using a word that it, by definition, does not include: Tea Leaves. To be an 'Herbal Tea,' there need to be *no* tea leaves in the concoction... So, why do we call it tea? Tisane is a much better term, and one rooted in history, too."
[author]: http://bobandgeorge.com/archives/000502 "Sometimes I really miss Bob and George as a web comic. I read it for most of my teenage years, until it ended in 2007... and its specific blend of self-deprecation and ad-hoc story telling was often imitated, but never duplicated. Thank You, David Arnez, for those 7 years."
[code]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/p/story-code-story-code-story-code-you.html "I got the idea for a story code from a tabletop game called 'Capes'. One of the core mechanics is setting up a 'Story Code,' or a list of things that must or mustn't happen in the stories that play out. They, in turn, got the idea from the comic book industry... which used it as a way to let many different authors write the same kinds of stories, with strict but well-defined limitations."
[pandp]: http://www.proseandprosody.com/ "I try to post, on average, about once a week. I write both novel-style stories (~650 words, in prose) and poetry which also tells a story (prosody). All of the work on there is original, 100% by me, and I'd love to hear what You think."
[thispost]: # "As of this point, I have almost written 4x the amount of text in title-text than I did for the actual blog post. If You are reading this, maybe You read it all... If so, thank You so much for Your interest!"
