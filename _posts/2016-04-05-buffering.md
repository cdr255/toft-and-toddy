Up until this point, I have mostly written my posts on a hand-to-mouth
kind of model.

When I wanted to write something, I would come up with a topic, write
it, and post it. I followed this kind of method for my music, my
writing, and every other creative outlet I have on the internet. If I
built up a buffer, I would clock out until I needed to write something
because it was all gone.

I've learned that, especially with the way my life has been going
lately, that isn't really a sustainable way to put out content. At
least for me, what that does is *force* me to failure, eventually, no
matter how hard I try. So, as with all things in life that are no
longer working, it is time to try and fix it somehow.

I'm going to be building up buffers for most of my outlets. First, and
most pertinent to this post, in the one for [Toft and Toddy][toft]. I'm
going to try to maintain a buffer of 5 posts, indefinitely. 

Whether that means I will post something from the buffer or not is to
be seen; I don't really know how some of the things I like to talk
about would work a week or two after I write about them, and I don't
like throwing things away without making use of them... But, with a
buffer of 5 pieces, I will be able to have a certain certainty about
posting once a week: I mean, I will have a month of posts pre-written,
in any event.

I have very similar plans for [Prose and Prosody][prose]: a 5-piece
buffer should be fine (though it wouldn't hurt to go further with it
than that since these are works of fiction instead of
editorials). This way, I can keep posting more regularly... *And* have
more time to edit my pieces a bit, which (while I don't intend for
pieces on the site to be in their final forms... It is still a
drafting site) should improve the quality of the work somewhat.

First things first though: I need to *even out the series* on
[Prose and Prosody][prose]. I have *13* different series running on
the site at the time I write this. Some are at their third
installment, others are at their first. Collectively, I will consider
them all to be the "First Season" projects of
[Prose and Prosody][prose]: Any new series I decide to add to the mix
will be a part of a new group, which will be mostly kept at their own
level of posts. My goal with Season 1 Series is to have them all at
entry 3 before continuing any of the others or introducing new
series. My OCD, I guess.

On my [Soundcloud][soundcloud], I am going to try to build up a small
buffer of short pieces. With the Classical Guitar added to my
repertoire, and Early and Traditional music at the forefront of my
non-original body of tunes, it shouldn't be too too hard to record
around 10 in a buffer. I plan, at this point, to start posting from
that buffer around April 15th or so... Unless I find that to be too
*taxing*, of course.

In addition to that buffer, I will still post my original works as I
finish them... But this way I'll have more original content being put
out, on a more regular basis. Might as well make my account more
active, especially if it motivates me to practice more, right? I
dunno. If it makes my channel less popular (haha) I will stop doing
it. But I think it is a good idea, at the moment.

Finally, my other projects ([Running on Sentences][running],
[Project Pygmalion][pyg], [Affuage][aff], [Saporine][saporine],
[cdr255.com][cdr255], and [Numenite][numenite]) are all excluded from
the new scheduling, since for the most part they are more suited to
the "As-it-happens" method of posting *or* I have put them on a
semi-permanent hiatus.

There are two projects I didn't mention yet:
[Visirod Reviews][visirod] and [Tumbling Owl][owl]. 

[Visirod][visirod] wasn't mentioned because it is largely a group
venture: Once everyone is on the same page again, we'll start that
project up again. It might not be until the Summer, honestly, due to
everyone's schedules and other life-like distractions.

[Tumbling Owl][owl], on the other hand, I have a *lot* of plans for. I
don't mention it here because it isn't launched yet, but come June
something will definitely be being done with it... And it will have a
buffer of some sort, unless I give up on this whole thing by then. 

Do You use a buffer of some sort when You create and publish content?
Have You found that it helps You as much as I'm hoping it helps me?
Let me know below, I'd love to hear Your thoughts.
