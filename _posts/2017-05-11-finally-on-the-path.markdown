I’ve recently taken the plunge. I finally started buying
[Pathfinder][1]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} books.

I’ve been playing [Pathfinder][1]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} off
and on since around 2013, when my friend Rachel suggested we play a game
run by a person she knew, alongside another guy who would eventually
become our roommate (for a time).

 <a id="more" /> Before then, I’d played [Dungeons and Dragons][2]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"} exclusively: I started on [3rd Edition][3]{:
target="_blank" rel="external"} (3.0, I know, I know) after being given
the [Holmes blue box][4]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} by my Dad.
I’d also gotten my hands on a complete set of [1st Edition][5]{:
target="_blank" rel="external"} books, given to my by my therapist at
the time (her son was getting rid of them, and like the huge nerd I am
I’d mentioned [Dungeons and Dragons][2]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"} to her). So, I was fairly entrenched in the whole
[Dungeons and Dragons][2]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} thing.

I’d heard some bad things about [4th edition][6]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"}, though. I’ve only recently gotten into [MMOs][7]{:
target="_blank" rel="external"}\: Before, I hated them. And I’ve never
really enjoyed streamlined games (more on that later). So when I heard
[4e][6]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} was a streamlined version of
[Dungeons and Dragons][2]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} that took a
lot of inspiration from [MMOs][7]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} (and
that [Tieflings were Core and Gnomes were Monsters][8]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"}!!!), I was unsurprisingly disinterested.

I also wasn’t exactly well off. I was never going to pay another $120
for [3.5e][9]{: target="_blank" rel="external"}.

So, this new [Pathfinder][1]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} system
was interesting, but I didn’t own any of the books. That was okay,
though, because [Pathfinder][1]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} has
not [one][10]{: target="_blank" rel="external"}, but [two][11]{:
target="_blank" rel="external"} separate online [System Reference
Documents][12]{: target="_blank" rel="external"}\: Little webpages that
have all of the rules in an easy-to-use, gratis format.

That was an amazing idea on [Paizo][13]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"}‘s part.

And so, since then, I’d been using the [PRD][10]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"} to play and run my games. This year marks the 4th year
I’ve been playing it, actually. But I’d never, ever bought a single
[Pathfinder][1]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} product… until
recently.

I want to support the [company][13]{: target="_blank" rel="external"}.
And I want to become a better [Dungeon Master][14]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"}. So, I finally decided to start buying the books.
Really, the decision came after impulsively buying two [Adventure
Path][15]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} books ([Mummy’s Mask][16]{:
target="_blank" rel="external"} 1 and [Iron Gods][17]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"} 1) and being very impressed and satisfied with them.

I’ve also signed up as a subscriber to the [Adventure Path][15]{:
target="_blank" rel="external"}, [Novel][18]{: target="_blank"
rel="external"}, and [Comic][19]{: target="_blank" rel="external"}
subscriptions [Paizo][13]{: target="_blank" rel="external"} offers.
Partly because I am very interested in this world they’ve created,
partly because I think it will help me to play and run games better to
have more of a background in the lore…

And partly because I really, really like receiving things in the
[post][20]{: target="_blank" rel="external"}.
