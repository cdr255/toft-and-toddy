Sometimes, I like to go on [Ebay][ebay] to look at certain things.

These are all things I would like, but [do not need][excess]: Things
like games for my [3ds][n3ds], or older, out of print
[board games][boardgames], or (recently) a
[rack based instrument preamp][ashley]. I rarely bid, unless I find a
good price on an auction. And it takes me a long time to hit a
[buy it now][buyit] button for whatever reason.

Anyway, I've been getting a [wargaming][wargaming] itch lately.

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

I have a small force of [Skaven][skaven] for [WHFB][whfb], but never
really got too into the game because of the [high buy in][entrywh] and
[power creep][powerwh]. I've been looking for another one, perhaps on
a smaller scale (so it isn't quite so expensive), and I will admit
that [Warmahordes][wmh] caught my eye a while ago. Sadly, I couldn't
convince someone to buy in with me the last time I got this itch, so I
was spared the cost of the [two-player battle box][twoplayer]. I
**did**, however, look at the factions available, so I know which ones
I like.

I like the flavor of [The Protectorate of Menoth][menoth] a lot, on
the [Warmachine][wm] side. And on the [Hordes][h] side, I think my
allegiance has to lie with the [Skorne Empire][skorne]. Other factions
look interesting, but those two have the best [fluff][fluff] for a
player like me. So, when I saw a [Menoth Battlegroup][battlegroup] up
for auction for about 1/2 the price of the going rate on
[Amazon][amabattle], I hurriedly placed a bid- $0.50 more than the
last person, thinking I would quickly be outbid.

I was not.

So, now I have a [Menoth Battlegroup][battlegroup] coming to the
house. I am currently on the lookout for another battlegroup, so my
friends have someone to play as against me (They've shown an interest
in [Khador][khador] and [Trollbloods][trollbloods] before, if I recall
correctly, I will probably get one of those). I have little clue what
to expect with the actual game, aside from comparing it to
[Warhammer Fantasy][whfb]. I'm sure it will be different, and
that I have a __lot__ to learn.

But, for all intents and purposes, I am officially a
[Warmahordes][wmh] player now! 

[ebay]: http://www.ebay.com/ "I told this story to my brother, Ethan, and he immediately asked me why I bid on it if I didn't really want it. My response was that I *did* want it, just not right now... But it was a really good deal, so I wanted to be able to say that I tried."
[excess]: https://xkcd.com/576/ "I do, in many ways, just like receiving packages. I am a member of a few subscription clubs, and getting those packages in the mail is exciting to me. But, I don't *need* them, or most of the stuff I want to bid on on ebay."
[n3ds]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_3DS "The Nintendo 3DS is a quality handheld which (I hope) will long outlast its shelf life for Nintendo. It has a lot of useful and interesting features, though the addition of common digital market aspects (like the free-to-start games and mandatory updates) are a tad annoying and worrisome."
[boardgames]: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=&_sacat=2550&LH_FS=1&LH_Price=..20%40c&LH_PrefLoc=1&_odkw=&_osacat=2550&_trksid=m194&ssPageName=STRK:MEFSRCHX:SRCH "I am a big board gamer, something I don't get to do as often as I'd like because it requires a lot of people to be in the same place at the same time. It's a completely different experience, sitting at a table with people, than on the other side of a monitor."
[ashley]: http://www.talkbass.com/threads/ashly-sc-40-preamplifier.344667/ "This preamplifier is the next thing I am going to add to my PA rig. I want this one because, according to a lot of different sources, it is built like a tank and has a neutral tone which will work equally well for my Harp and my Bass."
[buyit]:  http://atariage.com/forums/topic/164168-ebay-is-almost-pointless-now/ "I don't really like the idea of an auction site allowing people to list things that are not actually auctions. It skews the market, and to claim that it doesn't requires a lack of understanding about economics: If people can get something, *now*, most of the time they will. And those prices are often higher, which then increases the minimum asking prices for the bids. Vicious cycle style."
[wargaming]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargaming "Every so often I get the urge to play / begin working on some kind of fantasy war game. I love the idea of such a complex and interesting game, but I admit I have lacked the conviction to seriously get into it in the past."
[skaven]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skaven_%28Warhammer%29 "The Skaven are an army I fell into almost by accident... But I like them all the same. The fluff is interesting (they are basically all of the negative aspects of humanity turned up to 11), but the crunch requires me to buy a *lot* of units (they are a horde based army)."
[whfb]: http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Warhammer?_requestid=9851253 "Warhammer's setting is pretty cool, though I do take issue with the way they handle common fantasy tropes (elves, dwarves, etc). They take a more toy-fantasy styled point of view on these things, which doesn't engage me as much as their original content."
[entrywh]: http://www.polyhedroncollider.com/2012/11/how-much-does-warhammer-40k-and-other.html "In the end, truly getting started in Warmachine is going to cost just ~$50 less than Warhammer Fantasy generally would, but the absolute minimum to play is the rules and two army battlegroups... which in total just hits over $100."
[powerwh]: http://www.warhammer.org.uk/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=41892 "Power creep is something I have very little patience with in games. I don't like people expanding a game just to have a new product to sell,, and power creep is usually a sign that that is happening in some aspect. Wargames are no exception to that; they have it in spades. But even just getting started in Warhammer I noticed it, in the monthly codex release."
[wmh]: http://forums.penny-arcade.com/discussion/126072/warmachine-and-hordes-a-k-a-warmahordes "Warmachine and Hordes are 'Sister Games,' which basically means that they are compatible with each other, yet slightly different in mechanics. The biggest crunch difference is Fury vs Focus, and the biggest fluff difference is steampunk robots vs fantasy beasts."
[twoplayer]: http://www.amazon.com/Warmachine-Two-Player-Battle-Box/dp/B005SGGLNQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431019123&sr=8-1&keywords=two+player+battle+box "Perhaps it is my lingering resentments from my experiences with Warhammer, but I was not very excited to drop the money necessary to afford the 2 player battle box again. It wasn't very useful to me, after I decided to actually get into the game."
[menoth]: http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/welcome-to-warmachine/the-protectorate-of-menoth "The Protectorate of Menoth is an army of religious fanatics who are out to cleanse the nonbelievers. Crunch wise, they seem pretty middle of the road, with lots of different strengths You can emphasize or downplay as You build Your force. "
[wm]: http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/welcome-to-warmachine "Warmachine is the bigger game of the two, sort of like how Warhammer 40k is bigger than Warhammer Fantasy Battle. It has a more steampunk, civilized setting, and uses Focus: A more stable and reliable resource throughout the game than Fury."
[h]: http://privateerpress.com/hordes/monstrous-miniatures-combat "Hordes is the smaller game of the two, the WHFB vs Warmachine's 40k. It is based in the wilds around the Warmachine setting, and thus has a more feral setting. It uses Fury, a resource which starts off really strong, but gets weaker with each loss in the game."
[skorne]: http://privateerpress.com/hordes/monstrous-miniatures-combat/skorne "Skorne are definitely not a Good (note the capital 'G') faction. They have a very autocratic power structure, almost fascist. They are out to conquer others, and generally have a strong show of force to support that goal."
[fluff]: http://www.thewargamingaddict.com/wargaming-fluff-essential-or-window-dressing/ "Fluff is usually my favorite part of a game. I *love* or *hate* lore, no real in between for me. One of the main reasons I never got very far with Warhammer is, aside from the Skaven, the setting and armies just didn't really grab me."
[battlegroup]: http://www.beastsofwar.com/warmachine/andy-takes-warmachine-menoth-battlegroup/ "This is the same battlegroup that I now own. It was reviewed as being a pretty good way to start a Menoth army, and the models seem very well built (I can't say put together because, well... I still have to do that."
[amabattle]: http://www.amazon.com/Privateer-Press-Warmachine-Protectorate-Battlegroup/dp/B00441MT14/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1431019364&sr=8-1&keywords=menoth+battlegroup "I know that buying online is not a great thing to do for my FLGS... but I might burn out with this game long before I actually get any use out of it, so I need to minimize costs for now. If I decide to make a second army (Skorne, maybe), I will probably just buy local."
[khador]: http://privateerpress.com/warmachine/welcome-to-warmachine/khador "Rachel is the one who showed an interest in this faction. They are strong, heavy hitters who are really hard to kill. I have my work cut out for me."
[trollbloods]: http://privateerpress.com/hordes/monstrous-miniatures-combat/trollbloods "Ethan showed an interest in the Trollbloods, especially because of their lore. They are big, angry, and what do You know, hard to kill too."
