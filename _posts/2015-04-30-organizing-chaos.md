As I work my way through [redesigning my site][harp] for its relaunch
_tomorrow_ (Gee, I'd better get on that today then!), I have noticed a
few really nice things.

1. I have, over the past two-ish years, composed no less than __12__
   pieces of instrumental music and __7__ [chiptune][chip] tracks,
   arranged a __huge__ library of educational material based on
   traditional / popular music, and worked on no less than __4__
   distinct board games (most of which are not to the point where they
   will go on the site on Friday, but still),

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

2. Redesigning the website is not __ostensibly__ easy, but because of
   the [existing site][cdr255] and [Dropbox][dropbox] I at least only
   have a minimal amount of work to do on the actual content-content.

3. I am capable enough in my [chosen languages][harp] to put together
   a decent site almost completely from scratch, which (while not
   looking quite as mature as my old site) looks pretty good if I do
   say so myself.

All of the above things emphasize one crucial element of working as a
small team or one man workforce: [Organization][org].

When You are the only one working on a project, and therefore all the
time spent putting things where they belong or redoing work You
thought was lost is left to You and You _alone_, I have found it
__vital__ to try to remain as organized as possible. It makes things
easier to find, easier to work with, and lets You skip the boring bits
and move straight on to [Actual Work][procrast].

One sin I have a habit of committing when it comes to computers is
that of [Optimizing my Environment][opt] instead of working. Things
like setting up backups, configuring git and ssh and cron, or (today)
trying to finagle a bit of code to do something that another bit of
code could easily do are all well and good, in their places. But I
have the unfortunate habit of doing those things __to excess__, and to
the point where the time I have to actually get work done is greatly
reduced.

Now, [Organization][org] can certainly fall into that category, at
times.

It is not vitally important that, at all times, everything be
organized and well thought out. If You have a set time to do
something, it is much better to [Get it Done][GTD] first and worry
about that stuff later. But as a 24 year old self-starter, I am
constantly learning that the secret to life isn't following one ideal
or the other: It is about finding the correct [Balance][bal] for
today.

Anyway, sifting through the myriad folders and [tarballs][tar] that my
files were all hiding in today and sorting them into an [AWS][aws] S3
Bucket made me realize just how productive I have actually been over
the course of the last two-ish years. I hope I am able to keep it up,
and I shall strive to keep my work just a tad more organized in the
future so that, a year from now, I
[won't have to do this again][arbitrarycondiments].

[chip]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiptune "I make music using LSDJ on an original Gameboy (DMG-01). I am not amazing at it yet, but I am slowly but surely learning more and more of the intricacies of the system. Check out some of my tracks on Soundcloud!"
[cdr255]: http://cdr255.com/ "As I write this, this link goes to the current, old, live version of the site. But, in the future, it will go to the new one. I *may* change it to an archive of the old site, but I also *may* just leave it as it is. I haven't decided yet. Anyway, the structure of the old site was a *MESS*!"
[dropbox]: https://www.dropbox.com/ "I was given some free space because I had so many Android devices connected to Dropbox. And that may well have been the single best advertising campaign they could have done for me. Come November (when my times runs out), I will *definitely* be upgrading to a premium plan."
[harp]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/04/29/harping-on-my-new-site/ "I talked about it more here, but I am mostly working in Markdown, CSS3, Jade, HTML5, and Javascript. Of those 5, the one I am most interested in (and the one I am the least experienced with) is Javascript, and I am currently working each day to rectify that fact."
[procrast]: http://www.somethingofthatilk.com/index.php?id=40 "I actually can't code for too long, straight. Part of the balance I've needed to find below is recognizing that. I burn myself out, and become useless at it, if I go for more than a few hours without a break. Breaks can be very important."
[opt]: http://www.xkcd.com/554/ "This is probably my biggest computer sin. I *love* system administration: Installing software, getting it to play nice, setting up timed services, getting things working. So, it is really easy for me to do *that*, and not actually get any *real* work done in a day."
[org]: http://orgmode.org/ "I used to use org mode for everything from websites to journals, but now I keep it in its place: I use it for mind maps, to do lists, and project management (before moving the project to MUSE, when it reaches a certain point."
[GTD]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done "I am a big fan of GTD and similar paradigms, mostly because they all give me an excuse to simply *move forward* in some capacity instead of doing a bunch of busy work in the here and now."
[bal]: http://zenhabits.net/how-to-find-that-elusive-balance-between-work-and-life/ "It's funny to me how universal this concept is. I've needed to find a balance between so many areas of my life, lately: Work and Play, Healthy and Satisfying, Taking care of myself and taking care of others, Family and Friends... the list goes on. This is a vital concept in life, and should be taught more in school."
[tar]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tar_(computing) "I don't really use Zip files any more. Tarballs are so much more efficient, so widely usable and accepted, and can even easily be compressed *again* so that they are of a small size. I use them for many things, and only use zip files when someone hands me one."
[aws]: http://aws.amazon.com/ "I haven't decided whether or not I'll be keeping my traditional hosting environment for the website yet, so I want all of the content (at least for now) to be hosted on Amazon'
s Web Services (specifically S3). That way, if I decide to go with Heroku (like I did with this blog) it is no big deal for me to deploy there instead."
[arbitrarycondiments]: https://xkcd.com/974/ "I personally lean more towards the side of doing it right in the present moment so that I don't have to redo it in the future. But, like I said above, there are times when that is inappropriate... And it is better to just get it done as quickly as possible."
