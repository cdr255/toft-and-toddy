One of the things I like to do in my spare time is play
[Tabletop Role Playing Games][ttrpgs].

My friends and I have kind of fallen out of
[playing regularly][playreg], which is something I want to rectify as
soon as possible. The [memories][logs] and [treasures][pbg] that these
games allow us to share during a quiet evening at home are important
to me... and the [creative outlet][creative] is something I think we
all could use more of. To that end, I've been adding to my collection
of games this year... and one of those additions is a little game
called [Capes][capesrpg].

{% raw %}
<!-- more -->
{% endraw %}

Compared to [Pathfinder][pf], which was our mainstay for quite some
time before this recent sabbatical, [Capes][capesrpg] is very
[rules-lite][ruleslite]. I don't think that is a __bad__ thing, but it
is different: No more [3 hour long combats][pflong], and no more
[grid][rpggrid]... instead, a set of [4d6][dice] and a betting
mechanic not unlike [blackjack][blackjack].

For a setting, we have decided to start with something like
[Steven Universe][su]- but with a few caveats: No show-characters can
show up on screen in the game (No [Pearl][pearl], no [Connie][connie],
and definitely no [Steven][steven])... and for all intents and
purposes this is an [alternate world][alternate] to the
show.

Basically, we don't want to rely on the show's [canon][canon] for
anything but background knowledge and setting.

As for the mechanics, [IMHO][imho] there is one big problem with
[Capes][capesrpg] and the way it is presented: There is no single,
well constructed [character sheet][charsheet] that allows all of a
character's information to be seen at a glance. There is a
[minimal][min] one that just lists abilities, and one each for drives
and exemplars... but having more than one sheet for such a small
amount of data [makes me sad][sad] when [Pathfinder][pf] had __so much
*more*__ information needed on [their sheets][pfsheet].

So, I made a single, unified sheet which should work for all
characters in [Capes][capesrpg]. It has space for all
[crunchy][crunch] information about a character... and even a few
fields for the [fluff][fluff] as well. You can download it
[here][here], and feel free to distribute it to others. (All of the
graphics / art is original aside from the [Capes][capesrpg] logo,
which I included identify which game the sheet was for. All original
work is licensed to the public at large under [CC-BY-SA 4.0][cc].)

If You like the sheet, [let me know][email]! And make sure to buy
[Capes][capesrpg]; it is a fun game which (given a little bit of
[creative work][rpgwork] on Your part) provides many, many nights of
fun for You and Yours!

[ttrpgs]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game "I've mentioned these before, so I think I'll use this space to really stress the meaning of the term: Tabletop, as in, played in meat-space (not on the computer). Role Playing, implying a focus on assuming and playing out a specific role. And Game, stressing the idea that it should be a fun and enjoyable exercise. Most people forget how important these three aspects can be (although, TBH, the first one can (under the right circumstances) be ignored)."
[playreg]: http://stuffershack.com/last-minute-cancellations-of-one-player-what-do-you-do/ "Getting people to commit to showing up has been a pretty hard thing, probably the hardest thing I've had to do in gaming so far. Probably just the place in my life (and theirs) at the moment, but it is extremely frustrating when everything is prepped but no one can show."
[logs]: http://www.cdr255.com/end-of-the-empire.html "These logs really helped me to decide to give tabletop role playing another try: Reading through them, I can remember exactly how much I enjoyed running the game, for all of its flaws. And I want to share that with people again."
[pbg]: https://youtu.be/XGL8M-13Xbo?t=148 "Basically, this is my whole motivation for playing these games again. It isn't, by any means, an *expensive* hobby (at least in regards to a buy-in or some kind of dues), but it *is* a very time-consuming hobby. However, the Memories... and Treasures... make it all worth it in the end."
[creative]: http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/2w1wgi/creativity_and_tabletop_rpgs_reddit_i_have_a/ "Playing these games offers me two things, when it comes to creativity: 1. A chance to be creative without checking myself as much as I do with my writing or stories. And 2. A chance to see others be creative, too."
[capesrpg]: http://www.museoffire.com/Games/index.html "I bought this game almost on a whim: I had *just* gotten in to Steven Universe, and my friend Rachel suggested that I should run a Pathfinder game based around that universe. I didn't think that *that* was something that I wanted to do... but if I could find a system more suited to the universe (and to the types of stories that are generally told on the show) then I would be happy to do so. When I read about Capes, something clicked in my head, and I wanted to try it out. And yes, it works pretty dang well IME."
[pf]: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG "I feel like pathfinder is a good, generic system which has a few big flaws. Those flaws can all be traced back to a single root cause: Pathfinder is based on DND 3.5, and the culture Wizards had introduced around it at the time. While that is one of the first systems I ever played (my first was ADnD 1e), I have largely grown both disillusioned and tired of it, with all of its trappings. More on that later."
[ruleslite]:  http://classicrpgrealms.blogspot.com/2011/07/why-play-rules-lite-rpgs-defining-old.html "Rules Lite games are seen by most as being a modern convention, sort of a small scale gentrification of the hobby as a whole. However, it is worth noting that, at its inception, DnD was largely what we would consider 'rules lite' nowadays. Sort of like cholesterol in an artery, rules have built up over the years... and that is how we got where we are, with games."
[pflong]: http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?279301-Pathfinder-Ways-to-speed-up-combat "This is, by far, my largest complaint with Pathfinder: When playing a Tabletop Role Playing Game, I don't want to Role Play for 30 minutes and then do combat for 4 hours. If I wanted to do that kind of combat, I would play a Tabletop War Game (like Warmahordes) instead."
[rpggrid]: http://www.giantitp.com/forums/showthread.php?253862-D-amp-D-Battle-Grid-Pros-vs-Cons "And here is, by far, the single most present symbol of my problems with modern combat in Pathfinder and DnD: The Battle Grid. In the old days, there was no grid. Battles were fought in the theater of the mind, with all of the fudging and slight-player-bias that that allows. Perhaps, when I run Pathfinder again, I will run it that way instead."
[blackjack]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack "This concept keeps appearing more and more in modern TTRPGs: The concept of a resource You can bet, which allows You to do more if You succeed... but hurts a lot more when You do not."
[su]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe is the first TV series I have really, truly gotten into in a *long* time. It is extremely well written, the world they've built is amazing, and in general I recommend that You should watch it now. You will not regret it."
[pearl]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Steven_Universe_characters "Pearl is my favorite of the Crystal Gems, because she is smart more than strong or disciplined. She has a lot of the same problems I do, as well: Lawful to a fault, Difficulty relating to people, and a tendency towards using big words and gushy, verbose sentences."
[connie]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Steven_Universe_characters "Connie is my favorite human, because I see a lot of myself in her. She is strong and independent, but fears authority figures like her parents, even going so far as lying to them when she didn't need to."
[steven]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Steven_Universe_characters "Steven is interesting. As the main character, he is definitely the most developed... and, thankfully, that development isn't something that has tarnished his character in any way."
[alternate]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_universe_%28fiction%29 "I prefer the term Alternate World to Parallel Universe for a few reasons, the largest being the fact that (at least in modern stories) a parallel universe often intersects with the current one... even in an alternate world. More on that later."
[canon]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_%28fiction%29 "Very interesting to note the first series to use Canon in the canonical way for fiction was Sherlock Holmes. Seems almost... elementary."
[imho]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IMHO "In My Humble Opinion. Sorry for my IRC/Forum-speak."
[charsheet]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_sheet "The Character sheet is something I feel is all too often overlooked in modern TTRPGs. When it is present at all, it is often added as an afterthought, with no real planning as to what is important to the player during play."
[min]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_techno "I actually really like minimal techno, though I will admit I do not listen to it very often. It is something that I appreciate when I find it, but I don't really seek out."
[sad]: http://www.emotionalcompetency.com/sadness.htm "I suppose that, in the grand scheme of things, being sad about a game is pretty okay. But still, I wanted to rectify this... especially since I know that I can."
[pfsheet]: http://charactersheets.minotaur.cc/ "The Pathfinder Sheets I like to use generally have as much information on them as possible, specifically because it is such a crunchy game. Most people use one a bit less compressed than I do, more like these."
[crunch]: http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?t=3336 "Crunch is something we focus on too much in today's world. I blame the advent of video gaming: We are so accustomed to the *need* to have numbers and such everywhere that we feel our games lack *legitimacy* without them."
[fluff]: http://www.therpgsite.com/showthread.php?t=3336 "Fluff is considered a very negative term by some. Many prefer the term Lore... but that makes Crunch make no sense. So, I use fluff, but in a positive connotation."
[here]: https://cdr255.herokuapp.com/stuff "I hope it is useful and easy to figure out! I based the structure off of the preexisting sheets in the back of the Downloadable PDF, but put everything on one side of one page, and redid all of the artwork."
[cc]: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ "This means that You can Remix this sheet, Distribute the resulting product, and in general use this work as You feel fit... as long as You say the original was by me, and that You allow others to do the same to Your resulting work."
[email]: mailto:cdr255@gmail.com "If You use the sheet and like it, hate it, or think it could be improved, I would love to hear from You!"
[rpgwork]: http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/blueroom/plots.htm "The hardest part of Capes is thinking of scene plots. Here are some examples. Have fun!"
