I'm back. More on that later.

Today, I wanted to discuss one of the things that
[kept me up][insomnia] until 0630 this morning. The band I've played
bass with for the last year and change has gone on a fairly permanent
[hiatus][hiatus], and I want to get my [bass rig][rig] in order before
finding new people to play with.

**N.B.** I *know* I could just get a head / cab combo and call it a
day, but I've never [done things the easy way][easy] before... Why
start now? ...On a more [serious note][serious]: I want to be able
to have full control over what is in my [bass rig][rig] at any one
time, I want to be able to [plug in][plug] to any speaker / mixer,
and I just prefer piecing together my own rig to buying a
[premade POS brand][POS] machine.

<!-- more -->

Anyway, I just wanted to write my findings down on what, exactly,
belongs in a [bass rig][rig]... at least, one that I think will
[suit my needs][needs]. I've narrowed it down to a few things, most of
which [I already have][PA] in my PA rig, and could theoretically use
from that for now.

Here's a list:

1. First and foremost, a rack-based rig needs a [Rack][rack] to go
   in. I've got one for the PA, but it is pretty big... If I end up
   putting this together, I will probably order myself a smaller one
   just for this.

2. Any rack-based rig needs a [Power Conditioner][condition] to run
   it. I have a [Juice Goose][goose] running my big rack, but I can
   always move it to my bass rig if I start using it regularly.

3. The next thing a lot of people have included is a
   [Tuning Unit][tuner] of some sort. This is low-priority for me;
   I've never liked using one or two whole units for something that
   could otherwise fit in my pocket. Maybe way down the line.

4. The most important part, and what I have been looking for for most
   of the night, is the [Preamplifier][preamp]. I'm looking at
   something like the [Sansamp Tech 21 RBI][sansamp] unit, I
   think. This'll be the high price item, for sure... at least
   $250... but, it'll help me a lot in the future.

5. Obviously, this all leads itself into a [Power Amplifier][amp],
   which will run into a speaker cabinet of some sort (not a part of
   this rig, and therefore not a part of this post). I have a
   [Crown XLS1000][crown] that I've been meaning to replace with an
   [XLS2000][xls2000] in my PA rig, so that has more room. Since I'd
   be only powering the one instrument in this, the [XLS1000][crown]
   is more than enough.

Any [effects][effects] or other trimmings I might want can come later,
or be [pedals][pedals]. Hopefully, I can piece this together in a
month or two!

[insomnia]: https://xkcd.com/313/ "I *do* keep a rather odd sleep schedule, on a regular basis. It hasn't really effected my life negatively lately, but it used to be a big problem for me. However, I *do* find myself to be very productive and creative in those hours where I cannot sleep... So, at times, it is a good thing."
[hiatus]: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/04/22/reunion-tour "The hard part about forming a band with two people who have been friends forever but are just burgeoning into their adult lives is that sometimes they decide that they don't like each other anymore. Oh well, time to move on."
[rig]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_instrument_amplification "I prefer rack gear to pedals. It plugs in to the wall, almost never comes unplugged during a show, dows *not* run out of battery during a set, and in general just provides a bit more stable of an experience in general. That said, in this day and age, I understand why pedals are so very popular."
[easy]: http://motd.ambians.com/quotes.php/name/freebsd_fortunes_2/toc_id/1-0-3/s/880#882 "I like doing things the hard way, almost every time. The reason is that the hard way often *teaches* You more than the easy way, whereas the easier way is merely *faster*. I prefer depth to breadth, and learning to expediency."
[serious]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nuN1xFq1ic "This is a pretty funny sketch in a pretty funny show. This kind of situation is almost literally the one reason I am so no-nonsense, in general: I am always afraid of making light of something when I should be being serious, and taking my time when I should be working my hardest. It's actually very stressful, to be honest. Something I have to work on, to be sure."
[plug]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_and_video_interfaces_and_connectors "One of the biggest benefits to having a setup for the bass is that I will have one (or two) outputs from my bass that I can just hand to a sound guy or plug in to a mixer. The Preamp will help a lot with that, because right now my bass is limited by the tone it has out of the box. With the preamp, I can bring it up to line level and shape it how I want it."
[POS]: http://www.cad-comic.com/cad/20031010 "I've built my own computer, and my own PA rig, and I can with 100% confidence say that that is the best way to assemble both of those. Buying a premade setup is *okay* and will get the job done, but assembling it Yourself is cheaper, more maintainable, and more customizable than the alternative."
[needs]: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/110712-we-all-have-different-desires-and-needs-but-if-we "My needs at this point boil down to one thing: I am going to need to start auditioning for a new band soon. Last time, I didn't really have a set up. When I needed my own gear, I just plugged in to my PA rig and called it a day (spoiler alert: I still do this, as of right now). It does the job, but it kind of lets the bass get lost in the mix (and is BIG overkill to have a 12 channel mixer on board for 1 instrument."
[PA]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_address_system "As I have mentioned in a few other hover texts, I already have one rig: A Vocal PA. When I need it (If I start my own band, or if the band I join has no vocal gear) I will definitely just add in the Bass-specific parts to this and use it. I have no intention of permanently breaking that down whatsoever. However, I think that it is a bit overkill to have the 12 channel mixer in my bass rig as a general rule. And it is lacking a preamp."
[rack]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/19-inch_rack "I bought my first rack from a company called 'Pearson Cases', who are currently out of business as best as I can tell. That means that, when the times comes for me to buy my smaller rack, I will probably turn to craigslist or ebay... No reason to buy a brand new rack from a new company... Especially not a 4-6U one."
[condition]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_conditioner "Power conditioners are important because they act as both a power strip (which lets You plug many things into the same wall or extension cord outlet) and an intermediary between the dangerous, prone-to-power-surges wall current and Your >$1000 rig."
[goose]: http://www.juicegoose.com/ "Juice Goose is what Rich uses, and it is what I use. It is relatively affordable and very reliable, I have never had a problem with my 8 plug power conditioner, even when it was full."
[tuner]: http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/out+of+tune "Being in tune is very important. But, when a $20.00, pocket-sized device can do the same thing as the $100, 1 RU size device with the pretty lights, it is kind of hard to justify the purchase (IMHO)."
[preamp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamplifier "This is the meat of the hunt, so to speak. The Preamp is the crucial part of the rig that I am missing. With an Active Bass, I nearly have a preamp already (sort of): I have a 'Boom!' knob, which is a parametric EQ which raises the low end. But, that allows me to change the tone in exactly 1 (one) way... I need to be able to control it fully... and to boost it a bit before it hits the mix, without maxing out my pickup volumes."
[sansamp]: http://www.ebay.com/itm/151736829456?_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT "By the time I have posted this, I have already ordered this unit. I got it for $225.00 with free shipping (used), and if all goes well I will have it within a week. When I get it, I am sure I will do a post on it specifically."
[amp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplifier#Power_amplifier "The Power Amp is something that I am wary of upgrading. I will probably end up doing as I have described here, and moving my PA rig up to a Crown XLS 2000 (leaving the Crown XLS 1000 to be permanently attached to my bass rig... or sold) but I am unsure about it still. More on this later."
[crown]: http://www.crownaudio.com/en/products/xls-1000 "I have used a Crown XLS1000 in my PA rig for the last two years. It works very well, even if it is a bit underpowered for my speakers. I recommend it."
[xls2000]: http://www.crownaudio.com/en/products/xls-2000 "If I can eventually get a stronger PA in my PA rig, I can then host my own shows and stuff. That'd be awesome."
[effects]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_unit "As for an effects unit... I am not really huge on effects, to be honest. I'll prolly stick to pedals, and fairly cheap ones at that, for the foreseeable future."
[pedals]: http://www.tinykittenteeth.com/2009/05/27/it-is-not-a-real-guitar/ "Pedals are perfect for my purpose: Cheap, Quick, and Do the Job without having to be part of the Rig or a Permanent addition to my set up. We'll see if my opinion on that changes. I dunno."
