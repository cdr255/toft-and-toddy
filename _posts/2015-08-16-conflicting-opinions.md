[Games][games] are a big part of my life.

[Tabletop Games][ttrpg], [Board Games][board games], and
[Video Games][vidya] are all very important to me, both in the past
and the present. (I can, of course, only [assume][xkcdassume] they
will become more so in the [future][future].) But something occurred to me the
other day that made me reconsider just what I spend so much of my time
doing. A simple question, while working on a new tabletop [campaign][ttrpgcamp]:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">

[Conflict][conflict], as a rule, is *vital* to
[modern games][gamehistory]- and for good reason!
[Conflict][conflict] is the [interesting][interest] part of life; if
there were no [conflicts][conflict], there would be no [story][story]
to tell, no [challenge][challenge] to surmount, and no real point to
anything. Games use [conflict][conflict] as the meat *and* the bones
of gameplay, oftentimes at the [expense][expense] of anything- or
everything- else.

And that is not a bad thing. Like I said, it makes things interesting
and worthwhile.

But why do we focus so much on *violent* conflict? What is it
specifically about [violence][violence], [combat][combat], and the
like that make those more inherent to gaming than, say,
[emotional][emotional] conflict? [Intellectual][intellectual]
conflict? [Moral][moral] conflict? Why do so many games involve
[mass murder][mass murder nuklear power] as a main focal point, and
just brush over that?

(N.B. I am *not* saying games are "[too violent][dndviolence]" or
anything. [Violent][violence] games can be and are a lot of fun! But I
*am* wondering why they are basically the only major type of game,
when You get down to the [brass tacks][brasstacks].)

My first instinct is to blame the forerunners: Things like
[Dungeons and Dragons][dnd], [Final Fantasy][ff],
[Street Fighter][sf]. Heck, even [Space War][spacewar] and
[Space Invaders][spaceinv] were all about killing things. But I
quickly brush this idea aside, and for two main reasons:

1. Just because those games were violent in the [1970][seventies]'s
and [1980][eighties]'s does *not* mean we are forced to only make
games about violence.
   
2. Blaming those who are successful for something You think is wrong
   with a culture is, at its core, an [excuse not to think][excuse].

Some of my favorite kinds of [video games][vidya]
([Visual Novels][vns] and [Dialogue Based RPGs][dialog]) have very
little [combat][combat] in them. They are able to get on fine without
it, but they are also seen to largely be like
[choose Your own adventure][cyoa] novels: Fun, but without a lot of
player control. They are also so few and far between the
[fighting games][fighting], [jRPGs][jrpg], and such that not very many
people make or play them.

In the [board game][board games] world, finding a game without some
kind of [combat][combat] mechanic or bloody attack roll in more
common: [Ticket to Ride][ticket], [Carcassonne][carcass], and
[Settlers of Catan][catan] are three such games. But for each of
those, there is a [Summoner Wars][summoner], or a
[Dominion][dominion], or a [Risk][risk]. And, the ones without
[combat][combat] are (at least to my eyes) more [abstract][abstract]
than the ones with physical [conflict][conflict].

As for the [TTRPG][ttrpg] world, I believe [this post][stackpost] on
[Stack Exchange][stack] said it the best (subbing 'mainstream' for
'traditional'):

> "As a rule, you'll find that traditional RPGs work in the
> way you suggest: extended combat mechanics, single rolls for social
> challenges. Indie RPGs are much more varied in the way they handle
> social conflicts."

All of the big names ([DND][dnd], [GURPS][gurps], [Shadowrun][shadow],
[Pathfinder][pf]) have a big focus on [combat][combat]- In fact, whole
[chapters][combatchap] in their rulebooks are devoted to it! Whereas
the smaller ones ([Dread][dread], [Capes][capes], and
[Dogs in the Vineyard][ditv]) are more focused on the idea of
[conflict][conflict], as opposed to simply [combat][combat].

This is already one of my longer [posts][posts] here, so I'll end with
this: I can conceive of many kinds of [conflict][conflict] between
people. But it takes me a lot of *time* to do so... And it is hard to
make it *look good*.  Perhaps, the reason [combat][combat] is so
common can be boiled down to one or more of the following reasons:

1. Non-[Combat][combat] conflict is *harder* to write.

   Nuance plays a big role in many more internal
   [conflicts][conflict]. Smaller actions have wider effects, and it
   is sometimes difficult to accept that the tides have turned against
   You if You don't have a dagger in Your back. [Violence][violence]
   is simply the simplest way to solve problems, because "[Might Makes
   Right][might]" leaves little room for argument.

2. There are no *established giants* without [combat][combat] as a
   focus.

   All of the main rulesets that people base their games on have a big
   focus on combat: [Dungeons and Dragons][dnd],
   [Dragon Quest][dorakue], [Final Fantasy][ff], [GURPS][gurps],
   [Galaga][galaga], [Double Dragon][dd], [Megaman][mm], [Mario][smb],
   [Sonic][sonic]. When people are starting out with an idea, it is
   very tempting and easy to crib rules from other games... And most
   of those games focused heavily on physical
   [conflict][conflict]. Smaller games, like
   [Dogs in the Vineyard][ditv] or [Dread][dread] or
   [Always Sometimes Monsters][asm], get overlooked a lot.

3. Explosions and Bloody Wounds *look cool*.

   [Violence][violence] has its place, especially in the realms of
   fantasy and gameplay. Explosions [look awesome][explosions], Duels
   and Wars are [amazing to look at][wars], and few things are as
   unsettling as [unexpected violence][surprise]. I am not trying to
   downplay any of that. But there *are* other ways to evoke those
   emotions in people, and those are the ones which are
   under-represented in games at the moment... Probably because there
   is no real set way to make them feel as cool as the
   [violent][violence] alternative.


[games]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/categories/#Games "Games are such a large part of my life. As an introverted, anxiety ridden young man, games provide a common ground for me to interact with people in a structured environment. The shared common interest really helps a lot. I also really enjoy storytelling, fantasy / science fiction, and competition... which games (at least the ones I tend to play) have in spades."
[ttrpg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game "Tabletop Role Playing Games are something I always keep separate from Board Games, because of the complete difference in standards and culture between them. Tabletop Role Playing Games use pencils and paper, often dice or counters, and sometimes miniatures or a grid or cards. The focus on the game is more on playing a character as opposed to fulfilling a condition or getting the most points."
[board games]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game "Board Games, on the other hand, tend to use... boards... and dice, often include cards, counters, and miniatures, and sometimes use pencils, booklets, or other small pieces. The main benefits for board games is they are contained experiences (play in one night) and generally have a small learning curve / commitment compared to ttrpgs."
[vidya]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game "Video Games are often what people think of when You use the term 'Gaming' nowadays. I tend to view them as a subset of games. I don't talk about video games as often as tabletop games, but I do play a good amount of them... especially older (style) video games."
[xkcdassume]: https://xkcd.com/1339/ "Asserting anything without much basis in fact is a dangerous thing to do, but in this case I think I am fairly safe. I would give up a great many things if I had to, but games (especially ttrpgs) have so few costs and such a wide area of benefits that I can't imagine giving them up for any reason."
[future]: https://xkcd.com/887/ "What's cool about the future is that You never really know what is going to happen. For people with anxiety issues, that can also be a big point of worry... which is something games help me with a lot. Kind of like a good book, TV show, album, or movie, a good game relaxes people, takes them out of their life and into a world with clearly defined rules and borders."
[ttrpgcamp]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_role-playing_games "In line with the rest of this article, the term 'campaign' is used to refer to an ongoing ttrpg game. It's a holdover from the origins of ttrpgs: Tabletop War Games, where they would have military campaigns which could last years. Even that term comes from a violent origin, though not necessarily so... Interesting to note."
[conflict]: http://www.plotsinc.com/sitenew/column_art_13.html "Conflict is life, in many ways... Everything from deciding what to make for breakfast to making love is (or at least can be described as) some kind of conflict. Very few things in life are completely devoid of conflict. No wonder it is at the core of gaming."
[gamehistory]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_games "Games have existed for all of human history. From the simplest sports and gambling games to the complex behemoths we have today, one thing has always remained constant: Games were able to be won and lost. This conflict is still central to many games today, and for good reason. "
[interest]: https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/647970-boredom-is-the-inner-conflict-we-suffer-when-we-lose "There are plenty of boring bits to life... Some might cite their jobs, or waiting for something, or doing chores. But see, the thing that *makes* them boring is the lack of conflict! Of course taking out the trash isn't going to be interesting: There is no real potential for conflict there (aside from a smell or bugs happening if You don't do it quickly enough)."
[story]: http://gamingindustryiq.com/2013/09/27/the-importance-of-gaming-narratives/ "Story has always be omni-important to me, in most recreation and forms of media I choose to consume. Only recently have I decided that I much prefer games with an implicit story, and that is only a reaction to the overabundance of games that have either boring or overlooked gameplay in exchange for a rich and detailed story. More on that in a later post."
[challenge]: http://www.storyboardthat.com/articles/education/types-of-literary-conflict "Overcoming a challenge is so central to storytelling that literary conflict is defined in the type of challenge that needs to be surmounted. Man vs Man, Man vs Self, Man vs Environment... They are all defining the kind of challenge the person is going through in the story."
[expense]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(game_design) "I think that (usually) sacrificing any part of a game for any other part is a pretty bad idea. Too little story and there is no point to what You are doing, and too little gameplay and the game isn't fun to play or watch. It's the combination that makes it perfect, and in a big way the genres of video games that have sprung up in the last 5 years are just the sweet spots that click with a large amount of people. More on that later."
[violence]: http://readwrite.com/2012/12/31/do-violent-video-games-really-cause-violent-behavior "I am NOT against violence (or sex, for that matter. More on that later.) in games or media in general. I just find it odd that violent conflict is the clear outlier in modern games, across many different media. Why should that be? For a well rounded experience, *all* types of conflict are important and valid, not just violent... so why focus so much on that specific one?"
[combat]: http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/175950/the_fundamental_pillars_of_a_.php "Combat is largely the focus of many games. Strategy games, jRPGs, d20, GURPS, CCGs, and more are all centered around two or more people participating in some kind of violent conflict. And, even when the conflict itself isn't violent (like, say, an argument) they still use the same mechanics... Just subbing in a word here, or an opening paragraph there, and keeping on keeping on. Combat is a lot of fun, but arguing is very different from fighting. Why shouldn't it play differently, too?"
[emotional]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotional_conflict "Emotional conflict. Do I want this? Do I love her? Do I feel this way, or that way? Why do I feel this way? Why can't I stop this? What are You doing? Please let me be! Should I lie, or tell the truth? Will they still accept me? Am I too weird? What if they hate me? I disagree with this. These kinds of conflicts are all valid, and should not be resolved exclusively on the battlefield."
[intellectual]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument "Intellectual conflict. I am right. You are wrong. Why is this here? What did this person do? Where should we go next? Please don't do that. You are being stupid. That is mine, not Yours. What should I buy with this money? How can I make ends meet? Who is this person really talking about? Why can't I understand this? These kinds of conflicts tend to be solved using 'Skill Checks'- single die rolls, and can often ruin a role playing experience because of that design decision."
[moral]: http://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/intolerable-moral-differences "Moral conflict. Should I do this? Is this the right way? Can I abide that kind of behavior? How should we deal with this? When will I have to speak up against this? Has this spiraled out of control? Why are people acting this way? What is it that people really need? What can I do to help? These are often glossed over, quickly, due in part to two things: First, their lack of rules in otherwise rule-complete games. Second (and more important), too many other rules to suddenly involve a half hour of roleplay without grinding the session to a halt."
[mass murder nuklear power]: http://www.nuklearpower.com/2006/02/21/episode-664-civics/ "It's always struck me as a little odd that we casually overlook this fact. Lord of the Rings, The Dark Crystal, etc. all have a lot of fighting, but no where NEAR as much murder as the average dnd campaign or Final Fantasy game. How is it that this has become so common in games? In part, I think I blame things like Pokemon... but I'll talk about that in a later post."
[dndviolence]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_controversies "Since the nineties (or even before that) there has been a fairly widespread campaign against violence and sexual themes in gaming. I am personally for both of those things, in their proper place. I would never try to ban a game because it is 'too violent' or 'too sexual'. BUT! I am of the opinion that not *every* game needs ultra-violence or cheesecake... and *selectively* sexualizing or being violent against a specific gender or what have You is reprehensible. More on that later."
[brasstacks]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/get_down_to_brass_tacks "This has always been an interesting saying to me, because it has survived to this day in one form or another, even though very few people deal with the issue it still refers to: Sewing."
[dnd]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons "Dungeons and Dragons... Such a landmark game. But, it is also one I have many issues with nowadays. It is trying to appeal to the widest set of people (which, as a content creator, I understand) and has made so many questionable design decisions since the first edition that it is hard to recommend today. If You are really interested in it, try out Pathfinder, because it is 3rd edition (the one with the widest player base and the fewest oversimplifications) with some cool modifications... or OSRIC, which is a cleaned up version of first edition style rules."
[ff]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy "Final Fantasy is the quintessential jRPG for the west. Dragon Quest never quite took hold over here like it did in Japan. Up until Final Fantasy VI, Final Fantasy was such a shining example of what a good jRPG should be. It morphed into something else for VII, VIII, IX, and X... which I liked, but was different. And then, nowadays, it is simplified and focused too much on the glitz to be as fun as it used to be."
[sf]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter "I am not a big Street Fighter fan. It seems like the McDonald's of fighting games to me, to be honest: You always know what to expect, You can always rely on it and come back to it, and it kind of started the whole genre (or at least made the standards of the genre what they are). I've always preferred Guilty Gear, Dark Stalkers, Mortal Kombat, and Tekken."
[spacewar]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar_(video_game) "Space War! I *love* space war! It is a great piece of tech from a long time ago (pre-pong, even!) and has things like gravity whips, even back then. It is a shining example of what a video game should be, and is my favorite game for the Atari 2600 (which it was ported to)."
[spaceinv]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders "Space Invaders (and it's style of game) is my dad's favorite genre of arcade game. He loves shooting complicated formations of enemies in one of three ships, and dealing with whatever comes with it. I can see the charm, but I tend to get bored with those games pretty quickly compared to something like Life Force or Stargunner."
[seventies]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s "The Seventies were, in many ways, a golden age for gaming. Dnd, Traveler, Atari, and more all got their start in the 70s. I have a lot of respect for games from this era."
[eighties]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s "The Eighties were a Silver Age for gaming. Nintendo, Sega, Atari, Dnd 2E, GURPS, PCs, Board Games, Discs, Cartridges, Cassettes... The list goes on. So much came out of that decade for games... A lot of good. And, admittedly, a lot of bad, too."
[excuse]: https://youtu.be/cHIP9UtkQDQ?t=795 "The AVGN's quote here is one that I have a lot of respect for. I think a lot of people eventually use these kinds of excuses, that keep them from thinking, in order to end arguments and cease conversation on whatever topic. I *despise* that. Thinking and conversation are always good things."
[vns]: http://www.katawa-shoujo.com/ "Visual Novels are games like Katawa Shoujo (which, if You haven't played yet, go do it now! This link will go to their site!) which are almost exclusively dialogue with the player making choices as the game goes on, and those choices are all of the gameplay that there tends to be. (NB These are different from Dating Sims in that they don't show any stats, are not stat based to begin with, and don't *have* to be about dating someone."
[dialog]: http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/asmonsters/asmonsters.htm "Games like Life is Strange and Always Sometimes Monsters are right up my alley. My friends have categorized them as 'Games where You walk around and talk to people', and I think that that is fair. That is most of the gameplay in those games, making them starkly similar to Visual Novels in a way... aside from the graphics, and the overall presentation."
[cyoa]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure "Choose Your Own Adventure Books! I *loved* them when I was in fifth grade; I must have read every single one that my school had at the time. They were awesome, for what they were. But, in a game, there should be a little more player control than they afforded their readers."
[fighting]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_game "Fighting games are one of the few always-able-to-be-played-with-two-players games that we had growing up. As someone with a younger brother and a penchant for sprawling single player experiences, I've played a great many of them over the years. They are by no means my favorite kind of game, but they can be a lot of fun. And they are *certainly* violent, no matter how cutesy the violence is presented."
[jrpg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Eastern_role-playing_video_games "JRPG is a term which confuses a lot of people upon their hearing it for the first time: It *does* stand for Japanese Role Playing Game. But, Google that and You'll find the TTRPG variety fitting that moniker. And, just because an RPG comes from Japan doesn't mean it is a jRPG. A jRPG is a largely menu-based, turn based RPG with simplified mechanics, pre-made characters, and an often linear plot line."
[ticket]: http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/usa/ "Ticket to Ride is a very Abstracted game: You are building rail lines across a map, and have to complete a continuous line from one point to another in order to score points. Obviously not a violent game, but also obviously very far removed from individual interaction (in game, at least... Players interact a lot, kind of like poker)."
[carcass]: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne "Carcassonne! I *love* Carcassonne, simply because it lets people who otherwise wouldn't play board games easily play a game with people who have been playing for ages. It has that simplicity of form that Go, Chess, or Checkers has... and that makes it timeless, to me. It is a very well put together games." 
[catan]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan "Of the three big Euro games of the board game renaissance, Catan is probably the one I like the least. This is because of its design: It is a game based around trade, relationships, intrigue, and die rolls. It begs for a lot of people to play it, and I do not often have a lot of people around me. That said, when I *do* have a good amount of people around, it has always been pretty fun." 
[summoner]: http://www.plaidhatgames.com/games/summoner-wars "Summoner Wars is a great game. It's a 1 on 1, card based, grid based war game. Think Magic: the Gathering but with a grid and troops instead of summons on an abstract battlefield." 
[dominion]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game) "Dominion is the definitive deck building game. It's violent because of its system of attack cards and defense cards, but other than that is very abstracted. You build a deck which represents Your dominion, and You are trying to get the most plots of land in the group (the plots of land are worth victory points depending on their size, and attack cards do bad things to them, resulting in negative victory points). It is very fun, and a good game for people new to the genre." 
[risk]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game) "Risk... I will be honest here. I have never really liked risk. It isn't so much the length, the mechanics, the setting, or any one thing... It is, instead, their specific combination. People get bored of playing it halfway through, and that leaves me with gamer-blue-balls, which I hate having. So, yeah, not a huge fan of Risk." 
[abstract]: http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/SergeyMohov/20131121/205357/Levels_of_Abstraction_in_Game_Design.php "Abstraction as a means to avoid violent conflict is fine, but it often turns off many kinds of gamers. Most of the ones I know prefer having actions and consequences, on an individual level, to a nationwide level. More on this in a later post." 
[stackpost]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/68384/whats-the-difference-between-stack-overflow-and-programmers-se "This is actually a very interesting concept to me. Why do we simply accept that TTRPGs, in their most common form, focus so much on combat? The mechanic listed in their namesake is 'Role Playing', not 'Combat', so why isn't the focus on Role Playing?" 
[stack]: http://stackexchange.com/ "Stack Exchange is a great site, but closes a *lot* of its questions prematurely. To their credit, they leave them up... But still, it'd be better to not interrupt the discourse unnecessarily." 
[gurps]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GURPS "I have never actually played a game of GURPS. But I have seen them played, and read the books a bunch. The main thing keeping me from running it is that it is just as crunchy as Dnd 3e, which I have moved away from because of its heavy handed rules. And yes, in both of those I *could* just ignore the rules I didn't like... But if the rules are *there*, I feel a compulsion to use them... Especially when other systems simply don't have those rules, and we could play them instead."
[shadow]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun "Shadowrun is an interesting game, but one with a heavy bend toward player mortality. I would recommend against it except for the crunchiest of groups, because that is truly the only way You will not suffer player death on a grand scale." 
[pf]: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/ "Pathfinder is always a good system to play, if You are okay with the amount of rules it has, its focus on grid based combat, and the heavy bend it has taken towards being more video game like (Much like Dnd 3.5E before it." 
[combatchap]: http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/combat.html "This has always mystified me. Even for games without a huge combat focus, they still tend to include this chapter for one reason or another. Why have a whole chapter devoted to killing things in a game where You shouldn't be killing things left and right? It's very hypocritical." 
[dread]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dread_RPG "Dread RPG is an awesome game. It is played with a tower of blocks (not unlike Jenga), where each pull represents the players doing something extraordinary or going beyond their abilities. It has a heavy horror theme, and is one of the best Indie RPGs I have run in a long time." 
[capes]: http://www.museoffire.com/Games/ "Capes RPG is the other great Indie RPG I have run recently. It uses a betting system and a d6 to decide who controls the end of a conflict, and characters clash in order to force their wills on a situation. It is very interesting, and I recommend it to any group with decent role playing skills." 
[ditv]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogs_in_the_Vineyard "Dogs in the Vineyard is a game I am currently planning to run. Using a more poker-like system than Capes RPG, it has different stages of conflict (only some of them violent) and usually starts conflict non-violently. We are running it in a post-apocalyptic setting, with a Neo-Santa-Muerte ethos to it." 
[posts]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/archives/ "This post marks the 32nd post on my blog (with 21 of them being since I switched to this site and hexo). I am hoping to write more, but the style of post I tend to write (with the big title-texts and the wiki-style linking) takes me a long time to get out. I'm tempted to try to put out at minimum one post a week, but I am purposefully committing to this in a title text that I know very few people will read." 
[might]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_makes_right "Might makes Right is one saying I have always disagreed with on a moral basis, but one I have seen again and again come into play in my lifetime. It is an unfortunately common practice, and one which I try to fight whenever I can... Which is why I am trying to suss out nonviolent conflict in games." 
[dorakue]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest "Dragon Quest is a fun series, with art by Akira Toriyama (of Dragonball fame). But it never really took off in the US, and so we often miss releases over here. It is unfortunate, but at least there is a dedicated fan base online." 
[galaga]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga "Galaga is the game most people think of when they say Space Invaders, I have found. I prefer Galaga to Space Invaders, but Stargunner or Darius to Galaga. I suppose that is a result of when I was born." 
[dd]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Dragon "I have only rarely enjoyed Beat 'Em Ups for more than a few minutes. Games like 'Double Dragon' and 'Battletoads' (and 'Battletoads vs Double Dragon' are the reason for that; they can be a lot of fun for two players, and provide a lot of challenge alone." 
[mm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man "Megaman! The Ultimate Fighting Robot! Technically he has never hurt a human... but he certainly earned his epithet of the 'Blue Bomber' over here in the US. That said, I am very excited for Mighty No. 9." 
[smb]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros. "Super Mario Brothers was the flagship game for the NES, and is largely ascribed the honor of saving the Video Game Industry when it came out. It is a lot of fun, but as Game Theory's MatPat pointed out, he is quite violent... He likes to jump on enemies (crushing them), which is the most painful way to be killed." 
[sonic]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(series) "Sonic, the Blue Blur. He only ever really is violent towards Dr. Eggman (all of the other robots are really prisons for his friends, look it up) in his first games, but later on takes on a much more violent (albeit cartoony no-blood violence) style of gameplay.

I love stories with explosions, but I *also* love stories where the most explosive thing that happens is a gust of wind knocking some papers to the floor."

Movies like LOTR and 300 took full advantage of this, and resulting battles can be very chaotic at times, which is very interesting for the eye to see. But those kinds of awe can also be inspired in other things, I am sure of it. Like in Newsies, maybe, or in Les Miserables."

I prefer the kind of horror that gets in Your head, and messes with You, making You question Your safety without needless bloodshed. Of course, that is much more difficult to pull off... But still."
