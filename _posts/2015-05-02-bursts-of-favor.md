So, yesterday I had one of those rare, beautiful
[bursts of inspiration][tweet], and I was lucky enough to ride it all
the way to a completed prototype.

It's important, when You are involved in creative work, to (once
again) try to strike a healthy balance between
[inspiration][inspiration] and [discipline][discipline]. Both are
important, for different reasons, and relying too much on one or the
other is a surefire way (at least in my personal experience) to burn
Yourself out, and shoot Yourself in Your burned out foot just for good
measure.

I'll start with the digressive one: [discipline][discipline]. I've
been working on building up discipline since January 1st, and in the
past four months I've made great strides in that regard:
[Eating healthier][healthy], [working out][workout] regularly, and
keeping things [organized][org]... are all
goals that I have largely met and kept up throughout the year.

I just made a post [two days ago][org] about how important and helpful
keeping work organized can be. But [discipline][discipline] goes
further than that: as a musician, it is important that I practice and
maintain my instruments regularly. As a self-employed person, I need
to set my own time aside for work each day. And as someone running a
blog, I have [tried my best][archive] to remain disciplined and
regular since I launched.

We've all gone through that period of life where You want to
[run from responsibility][run] and just do nothing all day. But it is
important to be able to curtail that emotion, in life as well as work,
because it prevents You from [getting things done][GTD].

On the flip side, we have [inspiration][inspiration].

As I was working yesterday, I came upon an idea which seemed
interesting and worthwhile. Had I not stopped to
[smell the roses][roses], I simply would have let it fade into the
ether... but stop I did, and now I have another complete, ready to
play prototype of my newest [board game][bg] (pre-alpha, of
course... gotta see how it plays, which is one of the things I have
planned for today).

It took me over an hour to run out of steam and call it done, but I am
happy to day it worked out well.

[Inspiration][inspiration] is a funny little facet of humanity: There
is no telling where it will come from or what might cause it, but
everyone is sure that it exists because it can happen to anyone at any
time. However, [waiting for the inspiration fairy][qc] is a silly
idea, and most people (especially those in more creative lines of
work) recognize that: Sitting around doing nothing all day isn't going
to inspire You to do much.

In a way, __Inspiration is often born from Discipline__, and should return
to Discipline when it has run its course.

My point here, I suppose, is that had I remained
[disciplined][discipline], had I remained rigid, set in a schedule for
the day, I would have missed out on something which could benefit me
in the future. I would have let the most precious commodity I have, my
ideas, just pass by me, [noticed but not noted][meditation]. And that
would be a loss I might never feel directly, but would __certainly__
feel a while from now when I had no new material to work with.

But at the same time: Had I not been working in the first place, I may
well never have gotten the idea at all! If I had been playing
[Dark Souls][darkpost], watching a [show][steven], or hanging out with
friends, I would most likely have been fully focused on that, and
unable to even recognize the idea for what it was.

At best, I might have made myself a [note][skyro] of it, and come back
to the idea some 5 weeks from now, once that elusive flame of
inspiration had been snuffed completely.

In short, I am glad to say I am beginning to recognize the right time
to be disciplined in my life and in my work... and when it is okay to
hang out, ride my interests, and [go with the flow][flow].

And that is a good thing indeed.

[tweet]: https://twitter.com/cdr255/status/594322546750783488 "The game, which I am now calling 'The Duchies,' is a competitive town laying game where you need to build up Your town's stats in order to complete an objective once the game ends... and, do so better than everyone else."
[discipline]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline "2015 has largely been focused on discipline, so far. I have gotten in shape, gotten organized, and gotten back to my DIY nature (for the most part). It is a big part of who I am, and I am grateful to have been able to rekindle discipline in myself this year."
[inspiration]: https://stepsandleaps.wordpress.com/2010/08/18/open-and-closed-thinking-modes/ "Inspiration is largely an untamable beast, for me. That is why I have a voice recorder, a notebook, and Dropbox available to me at all times: when inspiration strikes me, it is important that I strike back, and record it in some way."
[healthy]: http://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/2015/03/09/why-exercise-is-the-least-important-part-of-the-equation-and-a-camp-nerd-fitness-update/ "Eating healthy is, by far, the biggest change I made in 2015. I have managed to lose about 25 lbs so far, and I am stabilizing around there. I feel so much better day by day, as well."
[workout]: https://instagram.com/p/182os2iHvl/ "My weekly runs are dual-natured: On the one hand, I feel so much better after running that I am always happy that I took the time to do so. On the other hand, I cannot deny that I find the actual *task* of running to be an incredibly *boring* one, and therefore I don't really look forward to running... I look forward to *having run*."
[org]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/04/30/organizing-chaos/ "Organization is one thing that I, personally, have a bit of trouble with. I have a natural tendency towards organizing things, which should (in theory) be a good thing. But when it comes down to *keeping things organized* during a days events, I am constantly under the impression that there is no time to do it right. So, I end up not doing it at all."
[archive]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/archives/ "I am actually very proud of this. I have struggled, in the past, to put out blog posts on a regular basis... And, with the launch of this blog, I have been able to keep up daily posts for over a week (and still have a good buffer underneath it, too!). I think that is a very good sign."
[run]: http://www.leasticoulddo.com/comic/20150323/ "This kind of thing is something we all must face, eventually. It is so much *easier*, on the short term, to run and hide. But until we stop hiding and face the day, we won't realize that what we are hiding from is largely just a series of tiny problems made to look big by our negligence."
[GTD]: https://xkcd.com/874/ "I've been very good about Getting Things Done, recently. I have been reading a bit more about Agile, too... and I think that those principles are just as applicable outside of software as they are for project management. And hey, it just so happens that I do both!"
[roses]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_rubiginosa "An interesting type of rose is the briar. I was introduced to it through the writings of Tamora Pierce, where a main character takes on the name of Briar when leaving the slums because he remembers the scars on his hand that the plant left him, and wants to sound just intimidating enough to be left alone."
[bg]: https://boardgamegeek.com/user/cdr255 "I haven't actually used Board Game Geek in a long time. I think I'll start using it again soon; my collection has grown so much that it'd be foolish not to. If You are on there, feel free to connect with me!"
[qc]: http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=1234 "It's funny, this is something I have only rarely had an issue with. I am more the type to trample inspiration, ignore it as it happens, than to prevent it from happening by doing nothing... at least on my good days."
[meditation]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation "I have not meditated in quite some time, but I have been looking to get back into it lately. One of the big rules I used when I was first learning to do it was the concept of 'a klesha,' or uncoloredness of thoughts. In other words, letting Your thoughts pass over You without focusing on a single one."
[darkpost]: http://www.toftandtoddy.com/2015/04/27/why-i-like-dark-souls/ "Dark Souls is the reason that this entry was posted so late. I got sucked into the game last night, and stayed up way too late. I got through Ash Lake and Blighttown, though, and the long ways, too!"
[steven]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Universe "Steven Universe is the first show in a *long time* to grip me the way that it has. It is almost odd, how much the first season sucked me in. It is a great, highly emotional show with good morals, great music, and memorable characters. Heck, maybe I'll do a world-building analysis on that world too!"
[skyro]: http://skyroapp.com/ "My brother thought it was really funny when I set myself up a voice recorder like a journalist or a lawyer. I agreed, because that is exactly where I got the inspiration to do so! But it has helped my writing out immensely, because I can easily remember little things I notice about life while I am out and about."
[flow]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcHKOC64KnE "Going with the flow is something I have always struggled with, too. I am a bit of a control freak, especially when it comes to problem solving. But I have gotten better over the years, and just like most things, that is a work in progress, right? Gotta Ride with they Tide and Go With the Flow as best I can."
